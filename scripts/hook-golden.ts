/**
 * Golden harness: every hook still behaves as recorded.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   Hooks are enforcement, and a broken one does not fail loudly — per this repo's own enforcement
 *   checklist a bad hook "still runs, still exits 0, prints nothing anyone sees, and its `deny`
 *   silently becomes an allow". So "the .ts file exists and exits 0" proves nothing. The evidence
 *   is: same stdin + same env + same cwd => same stdout, same exit code, same filesystem effect.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED
 *   This diffed each hook against the Python original at a pinned commit, answering "is the port
 *   faithful" — a question that closed when the port landed. What it kept measuring was whether a
 *   hook had changed since 2026-08-18, so every deliberate improvement read as a failure:
 *   image-read-guard's move to look_at.sh and its two security fixes (a `..` is not permission;
 *   deny on crash) all showed up red. A gate that goes red on a security fix teaches you to ignore
 *   it, so the baseline is now the hook's own recorded behaviour.
 *
 * WHY THE SANDBOX
 *   Many hooks write files and spawn subprocesses. Each case runs in its own disposable temp copy
 *   of its fixture, so a run never observes state another run created.
 *
 * WHAT IS NORMALISED
 *   Sandbox, repo and tmp paths, and the wall clock to the minute. Both appear verbatim in hook
 *   output (the look-at deny reason names a script path; session-end stamps LEARNINGS.md), and
 *   hashing them raw makes the suite go red on the clock rather than on a hook.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   bun scripts/hook-golden.ts <hook-name>        # one hook, all its golden cases
 *   bun scripts/hook-golden.ts --all              # every golden file in tests/golden/
 *   bun scripts/hook-golden.ts --all --record     # re-record after an INTENDED change;
 *                                                 # read the golden diff, that diff is the review
