# Bump the plugin version everywhere it is spelled, then tell you how to ship it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The version appears in SIX places across FOUR files. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` documented
#   three of them. The two undocumented JSON fields are enforced by
#   tests/public-extension-contract.test.ts, so a hand-bump that follows the old
#   documentation turns the suite red — which is how the gap was found, one bump at a time.
#   A procedure with six manual edit sites schedules its own next drift; this script is the
#   spec, and the doc reduces to "run it".
#
#   The seventh step is the one with actual blast radius and the one no file records:
#   `claude plugin update` resolves releases from ANNOTATED GIT TAGS, not from
#   marketplace.json. Push main without `workflows--vX.Y.Z` and the new version ships to
#   nobody — every installed plugin silently stays on the previous release. The script
#   therefore prints the tag command rather than running it, so tagging stays a deliberate
#   act: landing on main and shipping to users are separate decisions.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/bump-version.sh 5.106.0     # rewrite all six sites
#   scripts/bump-version.sh --check     # verify the six agree (no writes); exit 1 if not

The tag is what ships. \`claude plugin update\` resolves from annotated tags, NOT from
marketplace.json — main without the tag reaches no installed plugin.
