# Run EVERY suite in tests/ — JS, TS AND PYTHON — routing each file to the runner it actually needs.
#
#   ./scripts/check-tests.sh              # all suites
#   ./scripts/check-tests.sh session-flag # only suites whose path matches the filter
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The repo had disjoint suite styles and no command that ran them all. `bun test <file>` drives a
#   file that imports from "bun:test"; `bun <file>` drives a file that asserts at top level. Each
#   style FAILS under the other runner — `bun test` on a top-level-assert file reports "0 tests" and
#   exits 0, which is the dangerous direction: a suite that is never executed and never complains.
#   So `tests/bash-mutation-matrix.test.mjs`, `tests/implementer-identity-contract.test.mjs`,
#   `tests/lineage-contract.test.mjs`, `tests/session-flag-key.test.ts` and their siblings were
#   reachable only by being typed out by hand, and the shell runner that existed then globbed
#   `scripts/checks/check-*.py` only, so nothing repo-wide touched them. (That runner,
#   `scripts/check-all.sh`, has since been deleted — it had no caller either.)
#
#   The header then CLAIMED to run every suite while globbing `tests/*.test.{ts,mjs,js}` only, which
#   silently skipped the 20 Python suites in the same directory — the same "asserts coverage it does
#   not have" defect one directory over. Python is now globbed and routed too.
#
#   The routing is DERIVED, not a maintained list:
#     *.test.ts|mjs|js   imports "bun:test" or calls describe/test/it at top level -> `bun test`,
#                        otherwise executed directly with `bun`. (Both signals are needed: two
#                        suites use bun's injected `describe` global with no import at all.)
#     *.py               a file that DEFINES `def test_` functions is collected by pytest; every
#                        other Python file is a top-level-assert script and is executed directly.
#                        Keying on `def test_` rather than on the absence of `sys.exit(` matters:
#                        `tests/workflow_return_shape_test.py` and
#                        `tests/codex_second_pass_join_test.py` have neither, and under pytest they
#                        report "no tests ran" — the same silent-zero failure mode this script was
#                        written to eliminate on the JS side.
#                        pytest is invoked through `uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml` when `uv`
#                        is available — the same invocation `scripts/check-hooks.sh` uses — because
#                        the system interpreter has neither pytest nor pyyaml, and a bare `python3 -m
#                        pytest` fails suites for a reason that has nothing to do with the code.
#   A new suite in any style is picked up with no edit here.
#
# THE QUARANTINE, AND WHY IT IS NOT "CORRECTING THE CLAIM" BY LOWERING IT
#   Running the 20 Python suites for the first time surfaced 6 that FAIL, 4 of them for one
#   pre-existing reason: they open `hooks/<name>.py` for a hook that was migrated to
#   `hooks/<name>.ts` and never had its test updated. Nobody noticed because nothing ran them. That
#   is the finding, not an obstacle to it.
#
#   The list grew to NINE when three TypeScript suites were found failing at HEAD for their own
#   unrelated reasons, and is back to SIX now that the v5.103.1 line fixed three of them. Count the
#   `quarantine_reason` cases, not this sentence: it has been wrong before, which is why the
#   un-quarantine rule below exists and why it, not a comment, is the authority.
#
#   Fixing them is a change to the writing / overflow hooks, unrelated to the work that added this
#   script, so they are QUARANTINED rather than silently dropped: each is named with its reason, the
#   script still runs it, and a quarantined suite that starts PASSING is a FAILURE here. That last
#   rule is what stops the list from becoming permanent — a quarantine you cannot exit is a denylist
#   of inconvenient facts, and it already earned its keep: it caught three suites that were
#   quarantined on a wrong diagnosis (missing `pyyaml`, not a moved path) the moment the runner was
#   corrected to `--with pyyaml`.
#
#   Verified against a clean `git worktree` at HEAD: all 9 fail there identically.
#
# THE ownership_dq_test.py CASE, WHICH IS NOT PAPERED OVER
#   `tests/ownership_dq_test.py` ends in `sys.exit(1 if F else 0)` at module scope. That breaks
#   pytest collection REPO-WIDE (`pytest tests/` aborts on it), and it is pre-existing. The routing
#   above handles it correctly by running it as a script, which is how its own docstring says to run
#   it. It is NOT converted to pytest here: that is a change to a data-quality suite unrelated to
#   this work. The consequence to know is that a bare `pytest tests/` still aborts; use this script.

# top-level `process.exit(0)` terminates the run. Measured at e225afb —
# `tests/wc-audit-verify-batch.test.mjs` ended it after 12 of 27 files, bun exited 0 while
# `implementer-identity-contract` was FAILING, and its internal "16/16" was read as a suite total.
# Fifteen suites never ran at all.
#
# So the guard belongs where the mistake is CHEAP to catch rather than where it happens to be

# failure is fine and is what these files now do.
