**What a script already decides:** `constraints/ds-chart-typography.py` decides the registered theme, per-chart styling, the single palette and vector output. Whether the font matches the host document it cannot see, and that is this rule.

## Rule

A chart is part of the document it sits in, not an image pasted from another one. Set the
typography and palette ONCE, as a registered theme, before any chart is built.

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Every glyph in the chart matches the document's type** — title, axis labels, axis titles, legend title and labels, in-chart annotations | A serif page with a sans axis label reads as two documents. Half-converting (title only) is worse than not converting |
| **Register a theme; never style chart by chart** | A chart added later silently keeps the library default. The failure is invisible to the author and obvious to the reader |
| **Labels are written for a reader, in Title Case** — `factual_description` is a field name, `Factual Description` is a label | A raw identifier in an exhibit reads as unfinished work. The exception is quoted source language, which stays verbatim: title-casing a filer's words misquotes them |

**Figures ship as VECTOR.** The artifact of record is the vector file; the PNG is the fallback
for consumers that cannot draw it. `pyobsplot` is the Python default because it renders SVG
natively (tables are A4, `ds-table-figure-pairing.md`).

Matplotlib and seaborn stay acceptable fallbacks, and taking the fallback does not forfeit
vector: such a script MUST `savefig` both `.svg` and `.png` at the SAME STEM. A lone `.png`
is the failure this rule names.

The same-stem `.svg` is what `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/law-review-docx/SKILL.md` consumes on
its `svgBlip` path, matching PNG to SVG by CONTENT HASH because pandoc rewrites media to
`rIdN.png` and the filename is gone by then. Two prohibitions from that skill hold here: never
reference a bare `.svg` from markdown, and never convert SVG to EMF with LibreOffice.

**The raster fallback's resolution follows the ART CLASS, not a single number.** 300 DPI is
the standard for continuous-tone images and is the floor everywhere. Charts are line art with
type — hard edges and small serif characters — which publishers hold to a higher bar (roughly
300 halftone / 500 combination / 1000 line art). Derive the scale factor from the width the
figure is PLACED at, never guess it, and assert the result:

```python
scale = ceil(TARGET_DPI * placed_width_in / chart_width_px * 100) / 100
assert chart_width_px * scale / placed_width_in >= 300
```

Spend the resolution where the raster is TERMINAL — a figure flattened into a legacy
format nobody can re-render is the one that has to last. Where a vector copy travels
alongside, the raster is only a fallback and 300 is enough.

Chart-level config beats theme config. A single `.configure_axis(...)`, `rcParams` write, or
inline `font=` re-opens the hole the theme closed, so the lint below refuses them.

```python
# altair
@alt.theme.register("paper", enable=True)
def _theme():
    return {"config": {
        "title":  {"font": DOC_FONT}, "axis": {"labelFont": DOC_FONT, "titleFont": DOC_FONT},
        "legend": {"labelFont": DOC_FONT, "titleFont": DOC_FONT}, "text": {"font": DOC_FONT},
    }}

# matplotlib
plt.rcParams.update({"font.family": DOC_FONT, "axes.titlesize": 13})
```

Colour is A6 (`ds-chart-color.md`); this file is type only.

Find the document's font rather than assuming: read it off the rendered page (marimo sets
Lora/PT Sans; a Typst deck uses whatever the template declares; a docx uses its style).

## Rationale

**Why this exists** — Nothing warns you. The chart renders, the numbers are right, the check
passes, and the exhibit still announces that it came from somewhere else. In a filing or a
paper that reads as carelessness about the thing it is illustrating, which is the last
impression an exhibit should leave.

## Verification

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/constraints/ds-chart-typography.py <file.py|dir>
```

Exits non-zero on: charts present with no theme registration; per-chart font or axis
configuration; hex colours outside a single palette block; a matplotlib save of a `.png` with no
`.svg` save at the same stem in the file.
