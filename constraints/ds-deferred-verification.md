description: Planning to verify "later" which means never — verify after EVERY step

## Rule

Verify after EVERY step. Never defer verification to "later" — later means never. Errors compound silently, and by the end the root cause is buried under layers of transformations.

## Rationale

**Why this exists** — Deferred verification is the second most common failure in DS workflows. Agents combine steps "for efficiency," then can't diagnose which step failed. A 30-second check after each step prevents hours of debugging later.

## Examples

### Correct
```python
# Verify after each step
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(f"Loaded: {df.shape}")

df = df.dropna(subset=["key_col"])
print(f"After dropna: {df.shape}")  # Verify rows dropped as expected

df = df.merge(other, on="key_col")
print(f"After merge: {df.shape}")   # Verify merge didn't explode/collapse
```

### Incorrect
```python
# Combining steps without intermediate verification
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv").dropna().merge(other, on="key").groupby("cat").mean()
# If result is wrong, which step caused it?
```
