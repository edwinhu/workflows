"""run-constraints.py — auto-discovers and runs all constraint checks.

NOTE: invoked with `--with lxml` because several constraint scripts (ai-anti-patterns
wikipedia-*, writing-general strunk, writing-legal volokh) import lxml. Without it they raise
"lxml is required" and land in `errors` — i.e. those prose checks silently DON'T run. Callers that
invoke this as `uv run python3 run-constraints.py` must also pass `--with lxml`.

Discovers from two directories:
  - constraints/*.py       — plugin-wide constraints
  - skills/*/constraints/*.py         — skill-local constraints (co-located with their .md pairs)

Domain filtering: reads {cwd}/.planning/ACTIVE_WORKFLOW.md for `style:` field.
  - writing-legal (Volokh)  → legal only
  - writing-econ (McCloskey) → econ only
  - writing-general (S&W)   → always
