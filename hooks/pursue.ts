/**
 * Stop hook: hold the session on an objective until a COMMAND says it is met.
 *
 * This is what `/goal` does, done by running the check rather than reading the transcript —
 * and without a transport. `goal-self-send.sh` only QUEUES; its drainer needs the pane IDLE to
 * type into, so a session running back-to-back checks never provides a window and the goal
 * never lands. Measured 2026-09-16: `/goal` sat undelivered for hours while the session worked,
 * and `goal-verify.sh` correctly reported NO GOAL SET the whole time.
 *
 * The three things that make a Stop hook safe rather than a trap, all copied from
 * ~/.claude/hooks/main-thread-guard.sh, which has been doing this in production:
 *
 *   1. `stop_hook_active` — set when the stop was already blocked once. Ignoring it means
 *      blocking your own block, forever.
 *   2. SELF-CLEARING — the state file is removed the moment the check passes, so the normal
 *      ending needs no human action.
 *   3. BOUNDED — a round counter and a wall clock, both checked here. A hold that cannot expire
 *      is a session someone has to kill.
 *
 * INERT unless armed. The state file is per session, so this fires for exactly one session
 * rather than every session in the project.
 *
 *   arm:     pursue-arm.sh '<check command>' [--rounds N] [--minutes M]
 *   disarm:  rm the state file (the path is printed on every block)
