/**
 * Shared helpers for the PreToolUse gate hooks — TypeScript port of _gate_common.py.
 *
 * Ported first and alone: 12 hooks import it, and it defines the output contract they all share, so
 * getting it wrong breaks 12 hooks identically and silently.
 *
 * THE BYTE-COMPATIBILITY TRAP
 *   Python's `json.dumps` defaults to separators `", "` / `": "` and `ensure_ascii=True`.
 *   `JSON.stringify` uses no spaces and emits non-ASCII literally. So the same object serializes to
 *   different bytes in the two languages:
 *
 *     python  json.dumps({"a": "🛑"})  ->  {"a": "🛑"}
 *     js      JSON.stringify(...)      ->  {"a":"🛑"}
 *
 *   Every deny message in this repo starts with 🛑, so a naive port changes the bytes of every
 *   blocked tool call. `pyJson` reproduces Python's format exactly; use it for anything a hook
 *   prints, never `JSON.stringify`.

 * A CRASH IS A DENIAL, NOT A NON-EVENT.

 * exact opposite of what a gate whose header promises "it fails CLOSED" is for. Measured: a receipt
 * carrying `workflow: "constructor"` made `builtInOrchestratorDirectories` return `undefined`,
 * `permitted.some` threw, the identity gate then in place exited 1, and the approving conversation's
 * `Write` to arbitrary project code landed ungated under an APPROVED receipt.
 *
 * THE HANDLER MUST NOT ITSELF THROW. It formats one fixed-shape deny with `pyJson` over a string it
 * builds from the error's own text, and everything that could fail — reading `.stack`, a getter on a
 * thrown exotic object — sits inside its own try. If even that fails it still denies, with a
 * generic reason. There is no path through here that reaches `process.exit(1)`.
 *
 * IT ALSO MARKS THIS PROCESS AS A PreToolUse GATE, which is what `requireObject` needs to know.
 * An earlier revision defended `requireObject`'s `process.exit(1)` on a non-object payload as
 * "dying loudly" and exempted it from this handler. In a PreToolUse gate that defence contradicts
 * the paragraph above it: Claude Code treats a non-zero exit as NON-BLOCKING, so dying loudly IS
 * the silent allow. Calling this function is the signal — every PreToolUse gate calls it, and no
 * PostToolUse hook does, so `requireObject` denies here and keeps its exit-1 parity semantics
 * everywhere else (`lint-check`, `atomic-constraint-guard`, `writing-prose-check`,
 * `cite-fidelity-lint` and `pr-url-logger` are PostToolUse and reach `requireObject` through
 * `readPayload`/`parsePayload`, where a non-zero exit is not a silent allow).

/**
 * The per-session key for the DS subagent-completion flag file.
 *
 * WHY NOT process.env.CLAUDE_SESSION_ID
 *   Claude Code never sets it. The three DS flag hooks all resolved to the literal "default", so
 *   every concurrent session process-wide shared ONE flag file: a subagent returning in one session
 *   armed the Read/Grep block in every other session, and clearing it in one disarmed all of them.
 *   The variable's absence is invisible — the guard keeps running and keeps exiting 0.
 *
 * The payload's `session_id` is the real per-session identity and is present on every hook event
 * these three are wired to, so all three derive the same key for the same session. The env fallback
 * is the session-tree id Claude Code does set; "default" survives only as the last resort, which is
 * also the only case where the original collision can still occur.
 *
 * The result is a FILENAME component, so anything outside [A-Za-z0-9._-] must not survive: a session
 * id is opaque and must never introduce a path separator or a `..` traversal.
 *
 * WHY DELETING THE UNSAFE CHARACTERS WAS NOT ENOUGH
 *   The first version returned `candidate.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]/g, "")`. Deletion is not
 *   injective, so DISTINCT sessions collapsed onto ONE key — measured: "sess/one", "sess#one",
 *   "sess one", and "sessone" all produced "sessone", and "a#b" collided with "ab". That is the
 *   very cross-session flag sharing this function was introduced to fix, merely made rarer: two
 *   sessions whose ids differ only in a stripped character share a flag file, so one session's
 *   returning subagent arms the Read block in the other.
 *
 *   The fix appends a digest of the RAW id. The readable prefix is still the sanitized id (so the
 *   files stay diagnosable by eye) but the digest is what separates the keys, and it is computed
 *   before any sanitization, so two ids that differ only in a stripped character no longer collide.
 *   It also removes the `..` hazard structurally: a key derived from an id always ends in
 *   `-<32 hex chars>`, so it can never BE `.` or `..` regardless of the input.
 *
 * THE ONE COLLISION THAT REMAINS, STATED PLAINLY
 *   The mapping is injective over IDS, not over CALLS. When neither the payload nor the environment
 *   supplies an identity there is nothing to hash, and every such call returns the literal
 *   "default" — so all identity-less sessions still share one flag file, which is the original
 *   cross-session sharing bug in its last remaining form. It is bounded rather than fixed: the
 *   environment fallback means it needs BOTH sources absent, and "default" cannot collide with any
 *   real id, since a derived key always carries the `-<32 hex>` suffix.
