/**
 * PostToolUse hook: the deterministic prose audit + structural constraints after draft edits.
 *
 * Fires on Edit|Write to:
 *   - `drafts/*.md`   — markdown drafts (existing gate), AND
 *   - `*.typ` LETTERS — Typst letters (NOT slide decks; decks are skipped).
 *
 * ONE PROSE ENGINE, ONE STRUCTURAL ENGINE:
 *   1. scripts/prose-audit.py — every prose/AI-tell pattern system, de-duplicated, span-id'd.
 *   2. references/constraints/check-all.py — STRUCTURAL constraints only (bold-lead,
 *      topic-sentences, anchored-numbers, outline-sync): real logic, not regex over prose.
 *
 * WHY check-all's PROSE MODULES ARE SUPPRESSED HERE. This hook used to run a second prose engine
 * beside check-all and suppress the overlap with `PROSE_LINT_SUPERSEDES`, a hand-maintained set of
 * three constraint names. It named the wrong three: the wikipedia-* tables were in both engines and
 * in neither's supersede list, so every AI-tell inside an edited range was reported to the model
 * twice. The second engine is gone; what remains is the suppression list below, which is the whole
 * of the split and is verified by tests/prose-engine-wiring.test.ts. See
 * docs/DESIGN-prose-constraint-architecture.md.
 *
 * Neither engine is reimplemented here: both are the same Python scripts, spawned from the same
 * PLUGIN_ROOT-relative paths, so their exact strings and regex tables stay the source of truth.
 * Footnote masking, stylometrics and range-independent document signals now live inside
 * prose-audit.py rather than being assembled here.
 *
 * Non-blocking: reports violations as an additionalContext message.
