  // IN-REPO file in between passed containment (the target is inside the root) and recorded the
  // other file's bytes under this path, wearing the vanished file's kind and mode bits.

  // reports some other error still fails this test if it recorded decoy.txt's contents, which is the

  // rewriting is involved and the seam cannot rot the way a String.replace seam did.
