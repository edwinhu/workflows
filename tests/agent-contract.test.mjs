// Agent contract: the plumbing between skills/*/SKILL.md, agents/*.md and skills/*/ — skill
// preloading, agentType resolution, the read-only writer exclusion, and the retirement of the
// output-style path. (Was writing-register-contract.test.mjs; it is the general agent suite now, and
// ds/workshop ride the same wiring facts writing does.)
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The wiring facts this feature depends on fail SILENTLY when violated, so
// nothing in a normal run would tell you:
//
//   1. `disable-model-invocation: true` skills CANNOT be preloaded ("preloading draws from the
//      same set of skills Claude can invoke"). Listing one in `skills:` gets it skipped with a
//      warning to the DEBUG LOG only — the agent launches, the guidance never arrives, and the
//      review reads as if it did.
//   2. A missing/disabled skill in `skills:` is likewise skipped with only a debug-log warning.
//      This is how a dangling `writing-register` preload survived a major version: 87739f29
//      deleted the skill, the generator and this test together.
//   3. `hooks`, `mcpServers` and `permissionMode` are IGNORED for a plugin-scoped agent but
//      HONOURED for a user-level one, and a user-level agent answers to its BARE name. THE
//      DIRECTORY STATES THE SCOPE: `agents/` is auto-discovered by Claude Code and registers
//      plugin-scoped (`workflows:<name>`); `user-agents/` is NOT auto-discovered and reaches
//      Claude Code only through the `~/.claude/agents/` symlink, which registers it user-level.
//      A `user-agents/` file with no link is the silent failure: the bare dispatch falls back
//      and its hooks never fire.
//
// Assertion 1 is the load-bearing one.
//
// Run: bun tests/agent-contract.test.mjs

//
// An agent's body is its whole system prompt, so an absolute law written there reads exactly like a

// enforcement surfaces, and the difference is the rule:
//
//   NEVER-SEND  happens only through `Bash` — no writer tool is involved and none can be removed to
//               stop it, so a `hooks:` PreToolUse guard is the ONLY enforcement available. An agent
//               that declares the law, holds Bash, and declares no hook is running on prose alone.
//               This is the case the rule exists for: `assistant` states "THIS AGENT NEVER SENDS"
//               and routes through himalaya/morgen/gws/beeper with the same Bash tool `email` uses.
//   NEVER-EDIT  is enforced by REMOVING the writer tools, which is strictly stronger than a hook and
//               cannot be argued around. That is already asserted above, and it is why the three
//               reviewers carry no hook and need none.
//
// PLUGIN-SCOPED AGENTS ARE OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by exception: `hooks:` is IGNORED for
// an `agents/` file (asserted above), so requiring one there would demand dead config. THE DIRECTORY
// STATES THE SCOPE, so this loop enumerates the user-scoped tier and names nobody.
//
// The rosters are ENUMERATED across all three repos that ship user-scoped agents — this plugin,
// the teaching plugin, and dotfiles — because ~/.claude/agents/ is one namespace and a law that
// stands unenforced does not care which repo shipped it.

// ── EVERY NAMED HOOK RESOLVES TO A FILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One shape of bug keeps recurring: a NAME STATED AS FACT that resolves to nothing. A `skills:`
// entry for a deleted skill; three skill names in a register's prose; two hook names in the
// design comment at hooks/_gate_common.ts, reasoned about as if both were live. Nothing breaks at
// runtime — hooks.json's own entries all resolve — so only a reader is misled, which is why it
// survives. The suite already asserts skills and agents resolve; this asserts hooks do.
//
// SCOPE IS DELIBERATE, because a lint that fires on prose gets disabled. Two reference shapes
// count and nothing else:
//   1. a `hooks/<x>.ts` or `hooks/<x>.sh` PATH — but not one under `.claude/`, which is the
//      user-level hooks directory this plugin does not own;
//   2. a BACKTICKED bare name that is unmistakably a hook noun: `<x>-guard`, and `<x>-guard.ts`
//      / `-check.ts` / `-lint.ts` with the extension spelled. Bare `-check`/`-lint` are NOT
//      counted — they collide with CLI flags (`--check`), skills (`cite-check`) and plan-lint
//      finding codes (`acceptance-is-the-mechanical-check`).
// Inside `hooks/` itself the vocabulary is controlled, so ANY backticked kebab-case name there is
// checked — that is what catches a `writing-suggest-verify` whose suffix is not a hook noun.
//
// Exclusions are historical surfaces: CHANGELOG.md, scratch/, .planning/, docs/ (design records
// that state retirements), and tests/ + scripts/ (synthetic fixture paths like `hooks/x.ts`).

// ── EVERY HOOK THAT EXISTS IS REGISTERED, A LIBRARY, OR EXPLICITLY QUARANTINED ─────────────────
//
// The converse of the scan above. That one asserts every NAME resolves to a FILE; this asserts
// every FILE resolves to a REGISTRATION. The failure it catches is the one this repo actually
// shipped: three hook files, cited by four skills as though live, registered in no settings file
// and no hooks.json. Nothing errors — the guard simply never runs, and every reader who saw the
// citation believed it did. Silence is the whole bug, which is why only a test finds it.
//
// A file is legitimate if ANY of:
//   1. hooks/hooks.json names it in a `command`;
//   2. it is a LIBRARY — leading underscore, or under hooks/lib/, or its header declares no hook
//      event (nothing imports it as a gate, so nothing should register it);
//   3. it is on UNREGISTERED_BY_DECISION below — a hook deliberately left unwired.
//
// Case 3 is an ALLOWLIST, not an escape hatch, and it carries its own upkeep: each entry must
// still exist, must still be absent from hooks.json, and must be described as unregistered in the
// skills that cite it. An entry that gets wired, deleted, or quietly re-described as live fails
// here. Adding a name is a deliberate act with a reason recorded next to it; forgetting to wire a
// new hook is not, and lands as a failure.
