/**
 * A goal decides whether to continue; a loop guarantees something asks. `goal-self-send.sh` is the
 * only transport that can type into our own pane, so it is also the only way a craft dispatch can
 * raise the heartbeat — but it hard-rejected anything that was not `/goal ...`.
 *
 * Same session-id discipline as the lint-gate suite: unset (exit 4) and set-but-unreachable
 * (exit 3) are the two ways identification can end. Reaching either proves the argument was
 * ACCEPTED, and neither value can address a live session, so nothing here types into a real pane.
