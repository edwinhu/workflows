// Every place the plugin version is spelled must agree — including the ones no other test
// reads.
//
// WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM public-extension-contract.test.ts
//   That suite enforces the four JSON version fields against its own TARGET_VERSION
//   constant. It cannot enforce the constant itself (it IS the constant), and it does not
//   look at the version embedded in its own test title. So a hand-bump could leave the
//   title stale forever and every suite would stay green while the file lied about what it
//   was checking. That is the same shape as the defect this repo has been chasing all
//   week: a check that runs without verifying the thing it claims to verify.
//
//   `scripts/bump-version.sh --check` reads all six sites out of the files themselves and
//   fails if they disagree or if one cannot be located (i.e. a file's shape changed and a
//   site silently stopped being tracked). Shelling out to it means the script stays the
//   single source of truth: add a version site there and this test picks it up for free.
