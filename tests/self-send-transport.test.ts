/**
 * The herdr transport must ENQUEUE and let a detached drainer send after the turn ends, and must
 * NOT hand-roll `pane send-text` + `send-keys` + an input-line readback.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-02: `agent prompt` delivers text+Enter even to a working agent, but Claude Code
 * enqueues a prompt arriving mid-turn and does not parse slash commands out of it. Four of four
 * inline self-sends recorded promptSource="queued" with no `Goal set:` receipt; the identical line
 * delivered to an IDLE pane expanded into a real /goal. A self-send is always made from a working
 * turn, so an inline `agent prompt` can never set a goal.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-01, both directions from identical output: four self-send probes in this
 * session reported `sitting unsubmitted` and registered anyway, while workflows/f31b7734 reported
 * the same string and genuinely never submitted — the goal text never appeared as a user prompt
 * and the user typed it by hand. A screen-scrape cannot separate those two; `agent_prompted` can.
 * The readback also deadlocked its own collision guard (exit 6, "input box is not empty") on
 * residue it could not interpret, refusing a `/goal clear` that `agent prompt` then delivered.
