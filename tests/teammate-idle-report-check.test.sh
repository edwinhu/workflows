# Self-contained regression tests for teammate-idle-report-check.sh.
#
# Gated by tests/shell-suites.test.ts, which globs *.test.sh and checks each exit code.
# Run directly while working on it:
#
#     tests/teammate-idle-report-check.test.sh
#
# Each case builds a throwaway session tree in mktemp -d matching the real layout
# the hook resolves against (lead transcript + <session>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl
# with a sibling .meta.json carrying the authoritative `name`), feeds the hook a
# TeammateIdle payload on stdin, and asserts the exit code.
#
# Exit 0 = hook allows idle (exempt / reported / fail-open). Exit 2 = hook nudges.
#
# XDG_CACHE_HOME is redirected per case so the MAX_NUDGES state file can never
# leak between cases or touch the real cache.

# needs a Markdown parser, which does not belong in a hook. Both fail toward
