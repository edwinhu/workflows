"""Tests for hooks/writing-prose-check.ts + Typst (.typ) prose extraction.

Named `test_prose_lint_hook.py` until `scripts/prose-lint.py` was deleted; it never invoked that
script, and the name outlived it by two minor versions.

Covers (per the v5.42.0 design):
  - .typ markup stripping (prose_extract._iter_typ_lines)
  - deck-skip logic (hook._is_typ_deck)
  - hook routes .typ letters + .md drafts to prose-audit.py
  - edited-line scoping (only violations on touched lines are reported)
  - no double-reporting (ONE span per violation, whatever tables matched it)

Run with:  python3 -m pytest tests/test_writing_prose_hook.py
       or:  python3 tests/test_writing_prose_hook.py

# read the retired `.planning/ACTIVE_WORKFLOW.md` ledger. What remains in THIS file is what is still
# genuinely Python: `.typ` prose extraction (scripts/prose_extract.py), the scored AI-tic table
# (loaded via scripts/prose-audit.py, which replaced the deleted screen.py third loader), and the
# hook's end-to-end behaviour, which is driven as a subprocess and does not care what language the
