Tests for constraints/run-constraints.py APPLIES_TO scoping (D-w-8 / the documented gotcha:
check-all previously IGNORED APPLIES_TO and ran every constraint on every project → writing's
authoring-lint constraints fired on workshop decks, keeping constraintsPassed permanently false).

Asserts:
  • workshop project → writing-* phantom constraints SKIPPED, typst-* RUN, no permanent error
    (scored-tics-patterns, a no-check() helper, is skipped not errored);
  • writing project → writing-* RUN (no regression), typst-* SKIPPED;
  • no `workflow:` field → everything runs (back-compat: undetected workflow can't scope).

Run:  uv run python3 tests/check_all_applies_to_test.py
