// Every `*.test.*` file that hand-rolls its own assertions must be able to FAIL `bun test`.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured 2026-08-27: four files in `tests/` print their own
// `N passed, M failed` line and `process.exit(1)` on failure, but register no bun `test()` block.
// `bun test` sees a file with zero tests, ignores its exit code, and reports success. With two
// genuine failures live in `tests/writing-prose-check.test.mjs`, `bun test` exited **0** — and its
// summary line was the harness's own output being mistaken for bun's tally. 293 assertions across
// agent-contract (232), writing-prose-check (33), overflow-check (20) and typst-convention-guard
// (8) could not fail the gate.
//
// The harnesses are NOT rewritten into bun tests: each is also a standalone script with a
// documented `bun tests/<file>` invocation, and porting 293 assertions to change nothing but the
// runner is churn with a real chance of dropping one. Instead each is SPAWNED here, once, and its
// exit code is the assertion — the same "run it and read the exit code" rule this repo applies to
// every other mechanical gate.
//
// Discovery is dynamic ON PURPOSE. A hard-coded list of four would not cover the fifth, and the
// fifth is exactly the one nobody would remember to add.
