"""build_inst_own.py — 13F institutional ownership panel (replaces SAS build_inst_own.sas).

Sources 13F holdings from the Go-based EDGAR parser output at
data/processed/holdings_13f/year=*/Q*.parquet, joins with CRSP monthly
for CUSIP→PERMNO mapping and cfacshr share adjustment, then computes
IO metrics (NumOwners, IO_TOTAL, IOC_HHI, DBREADTH, IOR).

Output: data/processed/inst_own.parquet (+ optional .sas7bdat)

Downstream consumer: merge_panel.sas reads inst_own and does MERGE_ASOF
with ISS meetings. The canonical IOR is recomputed there as
io_total / ISS_tso; the CRSP-based IOR/TSO here are diagnostic only.

Deviation from SAS: cfacshr is looked up at the reporting-period quarter
(rdate), not the filing-date quarter (fdate). The difference is nil
except when a stock split occurs in the ~45-day window between rdate
and fdate.

Usage:
    pixi run python scripts/build_inst_own.py
    pixi run python scripts/build_inst_own.py --quarter 2020Q1
    pixi run python scripts/build_inst_own.py --no-pull  # use cached CRSP

# Step 0: CRSP data from WRDS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CRSP 2.0 (CIZ) THROUGHOUT. This used to be a SPLICE: legacy crsp.msf +
# crsp.msenames for everything through 2024-12-31, then crsp.msf_v2 for 2025,
# because the legacy tables freeze there. That kept every historical quarter on
# the source it had been validated against, and confined the CIZ universe to
# quarters that previously had no data at all.
#
# It also meant THE PANEL CHANGED UNIVERSE MID-SAMPLE. The legacy filter is
# shrcd IN (10,11); the CIZ filter is sharetype/securitytype/securitysubtype/
# usincflg = NS/EQTY/COM/Y, and the two do not select the same securities.
# Measured on this WRDS vintage (2026-07-27), distinct permnos in the universe:
#
#     2005-12-31   4,899 legacy   5,059 CIZ   +3.3%
#     2010-12-31   4,031          4,161       +3.2%
#     2015-12-31   3,796          3,984       +5.0%
#     2020-12-31   3,767          3,957       +5.0%
#     2024-06-30   3,930          4,095       +4.2%
#
# So under the splice, 2025 was measured on a universe 3-5% wider than every
# year before it. A single break of that size inside the sample is worse than
# being uniformly wider: it puts a discontinuity exactly where a researcher is
# least likely to look for one, and it is invisible in any statistic that does
# not cut on year. The 2025 stratum ALREADY reads as a different population —
# 4,059 permnos against 10,335 in 2024, and zero null denominators where every
# other year has many.
#
# One product, one universe, all history. The legacy tables are frozen and will
# never be anything but further behind, so the splice was a growing seam.
#
# The adjustment bases agree, which is what made the splice safe and makes the
# switch safe: AAPL 2014-06-30 is shrout 5,989,171 / factor 4.0 in BOTH tables,
# and 2020-09-30 is 16,976,763 / 1.0 / 115.81 in both. shrout at the old
# boundary differs ~0.5% (15,040,731 vs 15,115,823) — a vintage revision between
# products, which is why crsp_src is still stamped on every row even though it
# now carries one value.
# NO SHARE-CLASS FILTER ON THE DENOMINATOR. This query used to carry
# sharetype/securitytype/securitysubtype/usincflg = NS/EQTY/COM/Y, the same
# predicate as the identifier pull below. That is the universe definition, and
# applying it HERE conflated two different questions:
#
#   "is this security in the panel's universe?"   <- a scope question
#   "how many shares does it have outstanding?"   <- a fact, true regardless
#
# The result was 300,515 permno-quarters (43.7% of leg 2) with tso NULL and
# therefore ior NULL. Measured: CRSP has shrout for ALL 300,515 of them once the
# filter is dropped — ZERO are genuinely absent. The denominator was never
# missing; we declined to read it.
#
# AND THE FILTER WAS MOSTLY REDUNDANT ANYWAY. The panel is meetings-driven
# (merge_panel MERGE_ASOFs out.meetings on the LEFT), so a permno with no ISS
# meeting never reaches out.pass whatever leg 2 does. Of those 300,515 rows,
# 226,604 (75.4%) are dropped at that join regardless — for them this filter only
# manufactured nulls in an intermediate artifact.
#
# The remaining 73,911 rows on 1,657 permnos are the reason this is a fix rather
# than a tidy-up: they DO reach the panel — they have ISS meetings, so the panel
# says they are in scope — and leg 2 was refusing them a denominator anyway.
# Dual-class share classes, foreign-incorporated issuers with US listings and
# real proxy votes, units. The panel called them in scope; leg 2 called them out.
#
# Scope still gets decided, just once and in the right place: by the ISS meetings
# join, and by the identifier query below, which keeps its filter.

# Those are SUCCESSIONS, never concurrent. The undated join manufactured a
# second row per (permno, rdate, cik), which the downstream
# unique(subset=[permno,rdate,cik], keep="first") then resolved BY COIN FLIP --
# sorting on exactly the dedup key leaves ties in arbitrary order. Measured on
# 2018-2022: 8,804 such groups, 44.5% with a second position over half the size
# of the first. So io_total for those cells was one draw, not an answer.
#
# Same shape as every other defect in this file: a join that silently
# over-matches and returns plausible numbers. Note the CRSP monthly query above
# ALREADY does the dated join correctly -- it was simply never propagated here.
# DELIBERATELY UNFILTERED, as the msenames version was. This map answers "which
# permno did this cusip8 belong to on this date", and a 13F position in a
# security that is not NS/EQTY/COM/Y still has an answer. The universe filter
# belongs on the CRSP monthly join, which is where it is: filtering here does not
# reclassify those holdings, it makes them UNRESOLVABLE and drops them.
#
# Measured cost of getting this wrong: adding the share-class filter here cut the
# map from 191,048 windows to 109,273 and took leg 2 from 675,639 rows to 396,771
# — a 41% loss that read like an improvement, because the DQ line then reported
# `testable=98.9%_of_panel` against 56.0%. The unknown-denominator rows had not
# acquired denominators; they had been deleted. A coverage statistic rising
# because the uncovered rows left is the most flattering possible way to lose data.

# start made them overlap. All of that existed only to reconcile a frozen table

    #     clean baseline, 80.7% of violators show neither, and severity does
    #     not track them (median 1.069 "explained" vs 1.054 not).
    # (b) a second row-level parse pathology like the value=0 case: the
    #     row-level decomposition came back NEGATIVE and in the OPPOSITE
    #     direction. Violating cells are LESS concentrated, not more —
    #     top-filer mass share 12.33% vs 18.11% clean, >50% concentration in

    # CONSEQUENCE FOR ANY VOTING ANALYSIS, which is the part that matters here
    # and is NOT a data-quality issue: a lent share carries NO VOTE for the
    # lender. Voting rights pass to the borrower unless the loan is recalled
    # before the record date. So 13F double-counting inflates OWNERSHIP but not
    # VOTABLE SHARES, and `ior` therefore overstates the institutional voting
    # block by roughly the lending rate — about 1.6pp typically (clean-cell
    # median SI/TSO), but over 12pp in the ~3% of heavily shorted firm-quarters.
    #
    # This is worse than a level bias for `log_ior` as a regressor: short
    # interest is not random with respect to governance conflict, and borrowing
    # spikes around record dates specifically to acquire votes. A covariate
    # built partly from lending activity is then endogenous to the outcome it
    # is meant to condition on. Anything using `ior` as a voting weight should
    # net out securities lending or report robustness excluding high-SI
    # firm-quarters. Tracked, not solved here.

    WRDS's splits note (March 2017) shows Thomson applying split adjustments twice
    and at the wrong date, and states plainly there is NO CLEAN SYSTEMIC FIX. Their
    own mitigation is to trim or winsorize Qtr(-1), Qtr(0), Qtr(+1) around each
    split. Outlier rates around split quarters run 13.8% at Qtr(0) and 14.1% at
    Qtr(-1) against a 5% null, rising to 40.7% for mutual funds at splits above 4:1.

    You cannot apply that mitigation without knowing which quarters are split
    adjacent, so this computes it. CRSP cfacshr is the source: it is constant for a
    permno until a split, so a change between consecutive quarters IS a split. No
    extra pull, and it is exact rather than a distribution-based guess.

    Flags rather than drops, deliberately. Dropping here would silently shrink every
    downstream sample and bury the choice inside a build script; the trade between
    coverage and split contamination belongs to the analysis, stated in its own
    methods section. `split_adjacent` is the winsorize-or-exclude switch.

    Note this matters MORE for anything S12-derived than for 13F: funds fare worse

    crsp.msenames also stops at 2024-12-31 and has ZERO null nameendt, so every
    validity window closes there and `rdate <= nameendt` dropped all of 2025 —
    0 cusip8 matches, io_total null for all 15,546 rows. Fixed by splicing
    crsp.stocknames_v2.

    A detector that lives in a test suite catches nothing at build time. So the
    check runs HERE, on the output, where it is blind to which upstream table
    froze — which is the point: the next frozen reference table will be a third
    one nobody has looked at.

    Deliberately silent when the column is null in EVERY period: that is a
    reference table never joined at all, a different defect, and reporting it
    here would bury this one.

    """Add ownership net of securities lending, for use as a VOTING weight.

    `ior` is the right measure of institutional OWNERSHIP and must not be capped: 13F
    is long-only, so a lent share is legitimately reported twice (lender plus the buyer
    who bought from the short seller), and above 100% is correct for a heavily shorted
    stock. WRDS's own support article leads with this cause; the violation rate rises
    0.51% -> 2.16% -> 6.99% -> 22.95% across short-interest buckets of 0-2 / 2-5 / 5-10
    / >10% of TSO.

    It is the WRONG measure of institutional VOTING POWER. A lent share carries no vote
    for the lender — the vote passes to the borrower unless the loan is recalled before
    the record date — so the double count inflates ownership but not votable shares.

        io_total_net = io_total - (shortint * cfacshr)

    cfacshr is applied here, not in the short-interest pull, because io_total is CRSP
    cfacshr-adjusted to a current-share basis while Compustat `shortint` is
    as-reported. Subtracting them unadjusted silently mixes bases across every split.

    BOUNDS, both directions, because no single number is defensible on its own:
      - SI understates shares on loan (borrowing also happens for hedging, tax and
        record-date vote acquisition), so this under-corrects.
      - It credits all lending to 13F institutions, though retail street-name shares are
        lent too, so it over-corrects.
      - It ignores recall before the record date, so it over-corrects again.
    Treat `ior` as an upper bound on institutional voting power and `ior_net` as a lower
    bound, and report both. Do not quietly swap one for the other.

    Rows with no short-interest match keep io_total_net = io_total and are flagged via
    si_missing, so a missing merge can never masquerade as zero lending.
