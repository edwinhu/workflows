"""build_short_interest.py — quarter-end short interest at permno, for netting lent
shares out of institutional ownership.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Form 13F reports LONG positions only. A lent share is reported twice:
once by the lender, who still carries it, and once by whoever bought it from the short
seller. That is why summed 13F ownership legitimately exceeds 100% for heavily shorted
stocks (WRDS support article "Institutional Ownership Exceeding 100%"; violation rate
rises 0.51% -> 22.95% across short-interest buckets of 0-2% to >10% of TSO).

For OWNERSHIP that double count is correct and must not be repaired. For VOTING it is
not: a lent share carries no vote for the lender — the vote passes to the borrower
unless the loan is recalled before the record date. So any use of institutional
ownership as a voting weight overstates the block by roughly the lending rate.

    votable institutional shares  ~=  reported institutional shares  -  shares on loan

Short interest is the observable proxy for shares on loan. Every shorted share was
borrowed from a long holder who thereby lost the vote.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. This is an upper-bound correction, and the direction of every
assumption is stated so it can be argued with:

  - Shares on loan >= short interest. Borrowing also happens for hedging, tax, and
    record-date vote acquisition. So SI UNDERSTATES lending and the correction is
    CONSERVATIVE — netted ownership is still an upper bound on votable shares.
  - It assumes the lender is a 13F institution. Institutions dominate lendable supply,
    but retail shares in street name are lent too, so this OVERSTATES the institutional
    share of lending and cuts the other way.
  - It assumes loans are not recalled before the record date. Recall for voting does
    happen, which again means the true vote loss is smaller than SI implies.

Net: treat `ior_net` as a lower bound on institutional voting power and `ior` as an
upper bound. Report both rather than picking one.

UNITS. `shortint` is as-reported at `datadate`; `io_total` in inst_own is CRSP
cfacshr-adjusted to a current-share basis. The two are NOT comparable until the same
factor is applied, so this script deliberately does NOT use Compustat's own
`shortintadj` (which is adjusted to Compustat's `splitadjdate`, a different basis).
The cfacshr multiply happens downstream in build_inst_own, where the matching factor
already lives on the row.
