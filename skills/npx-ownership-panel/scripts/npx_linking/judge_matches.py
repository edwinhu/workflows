"""Adjudicate accepted name matches with an LLM and drop the wrong ones.

WHY THIS IS PART OF THE PROCEDURE, NOT A SIDE CHECK

Cosine similarity cannot distinguish a fund from its sibling. Measured
2026-08-28 by judging ALL 18,975 accepted pairs:

    score band     judged same
      0.70-0.75        47.0%
      0.75-0.85        58.3%
      0.85-0.95        74.3%
      0.95-1.00        93.3%
      1.00             99.8%

    overall, by vote rows: 94.91% correct

The errors are same-family, different-portfolio, and they sit at HIGH scores:
`Royce Value Trust` vs `Royce Value Fund` (closed-end vs open-end) at 0.95,
`PROSHARES ULTRA RUSSELL 3000` vs `Ultra Russell 2000 ProShares` at 0.84,
`TIAA-CREF SMALL-CAP GROWTH INDEX` vs `TIAA-CREF Large-Cap Growth Index` at
0.73. No threshold separates them, so no amount of matcher tuning removes them.

Running this takes the panel from 98.84% linked to 97.16% linked-AND-CHECKED,
which is a materially better dataset than the larger number.

A NOTE ON THE PER-BAND FIGURES. A negative control -- hiding the seriesid of
funds ISS did tag and re-matching them -- put the same bands 20 points higher
(68.9% where this says 47.0%). The control is systematically easier: those funds
are modern, well-formed, and 69% match exactly. Trust the judged numbers for the
untagged population; the control flatters it.

COST: $1.55 for 18,975 pairs on a flash-lite batch (6.74M input +
0.43M output tokens). Judging everything is cheaper than reasoning about a
sample.

Usage:
    python judge_matches.py build   pairs.csv out_dir/    # write request JSONL
    python judge_matches.py submit  out_dir/              # upload + create jobs
    python judge_matches.py collect out_dir/ pairs.csv    # verdicts + rejects

#: the saved OUTPUT, not the ability to regenerate it.

PROMPT = """You compare two US mutual fund names and decide whether they name \
THE SAME FUND (the same portfolio / series), or two DIFFERENT funds.

Fund families reuse their brand across dozens of distinct portfolios, so a \
shared manager name is NOT evidence of a match. Judge the PORTFOLIO.

Different funds, even though the names look similar:
  - a numbered or lettered sibling: "Convertible & Income Fund II" vs "Convertible Fund"
  - a different asset class: "Total Return Strategy" (equity) vs "Total Return Bond"
  - a different mandate: "Global Utility Income" vs "Real Estate Income"
  - a different cap or style: "Small-Cap Value" vs "All Cap"

The same fund, despite differing text:
  - a rename: "Dreyfus Municipal Bond Fund" vs "BNY Mellon Municipal Bond Fund"
  - a sub-adviser or share class appended: "Core Fund - SUB-ADVISER: X" vs "Core Fund"
  - an internal code prefixed: "6721 500 Index B" vs "500 Index Fund"
  - the registrant's name prefixed: "Equity Income Portfolio" vs \
"Northwestern Mutual Series Fund Equity Income Portfolio"
