"""L3b — the `feeder_master_name` tier. UPDATES `data/processed/npx_crsp_link.parquet`.

The gap this closes (reproduced by VERIFY 0 below, do not take it on trust):
**995 fundids / 4,439,333 vote rows (3.08% of the panel) carry an L2 `seriesid`
but no `crsp_fundno`.** All 995 seriesIds are absent from `crsp_cik_map`, so
this is not a broken join — those series genuinely are not in CRSP's series map.

CORRECTION to the framing this task was handed: L3's fuzzy tiers were NOT
gated on `match_tier == 'unresolved'`. Its `todo` is an anti-join on the exact
tiers, so all 995 of these fundids DID enter `crsp_name_scoped`/`crsp_name_global`
and were rejected there (946 of them appear in `l3_adjudication_unlinked.csv`).
There is no population hole. What L3 could not do is bridge the MASTER-to-FEEDER
name distance, because its normalisation kept the structural words that are
exactly what differs between a master portfolio and the feeder CRSP tracks, and
kept the leading internal sub-account code ISS puts on VA entries. **L3b is a
NORMALISATION change, not a population change** — which is also why it must
clear a much HIGHER bar than L3 (0.97 both tiers, vs L3's 0.80/0.85): removing
`MASTER`/`SERIES`/`PORTFOLIO`/`FUND`/`TRUST` and the sponsor prefix raises every
score mechanically, so the old thresholds would no longer mean what they meant.

Why part of the residual is matchable: the largest gap funds are master
portfolios in master-feeder structures (the master files its own N-PX because
it holds the securities; CRSP tracks only the feeder, whose name is
near-identical once the structural words go) and insurance separate accounts.

A SECOND correction, also measured: the specific funds this task named as
recoverable mostly are NOT in `fund_summary2` at all. CRSP carries exactly ONE
DFA tax-managed portfolio (Tax-Managed US Marketwide Value) -- there is no
`DFA Tax-Managed U.S. Equity`, `... Small Cap` or `... Targeted Value` to match,
so those three (367K vote rows) stay unlinked and should. BlackRock's `MASTER
SMALL CAP INDEX SERIES` / `MASTER EXTENDED MARKET INDEX SERIES` / `Large Cap
Index Master Portfolio` have no CRSP feeder under a matching name either (best
in-scope candidate 0.75, 0.36, 0.62). What this tier DOES recover of that
population is the BlackRock `S&P 500 Index Master Portfolio`, `Diversified
Equity Master Portfolio`, `Master Advantage Large Cap Core Portfolio`, the nine
`LifePath Index <year> Master Portfolio`s, DFA's `U.S. Large Cap Value Series`
and `U.S. Large Company Series`, Eaton Vance's and AllianceBernstein's master
portfolios, and the whole VA/sub-account-code population.

What this tier does
-------------------
1. Two name SPACES, both sides normalised identically: `full` (structural words
   kept) and `core` (MASTER/SERIES/PORTFOLIO/FUND/TRUST/ACCOUNT/... removed).
   A candidate may come from either; the space is recorded on the match.
2. Six ISS query FORMS, each recorded on the match it wins:
     name              the fund name as ISS writes it
     lead_drop         one leading internal sub-account code token dropped
     lead_drop2        two (each level is separate: a single greedy strip eats
                       the "500" in "6721 500 Index B", the fund's identity)
     sponsor_drop      leading tokens that repeat the ISS institution name
     tail_segment      the segment after a trust separator ("UNIVERSAL
                       INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS, INC. - U.S. REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO")
     paren_underlying  for separate-account wrappers only, the parenthetical
                       naming the fund actually held ("TIAA Separate Account
                       VA-1 (TIAA Stock Index Account)")
3. The SPONSOR PREFIX is stripped from both sides, never guessed: on the CRSP
   side the tokens must already appear in that fund's own trust prefix
   ("BlackRock Index Funds, Inc: BlackRock S&P 500 Index Fund" -> "S P 500
   INDEX FUND"), on the ISS side in its own institution name. That prefix is
   about a third of the character mass and it alone took the BlackRock S&P 500
   master/feeder pair from 1.00 to 0.66.
4. `U.S.` is folded to `US` on both sides — ISS writes the dots, CRSP does not,
   and the L2/L3 normaliser turned that into a two-token vs one-token mismatch.
5. The digit-token and series-designator guards are kept at FULL strength, but
   evaluated against the query form actually used. A match won through
   `lead_drop` never has to find `6721` in the CRSP name; a match won through
   the full name still has to reproduce every digit token in it. That is the
   whole exemption — positional, not a weakening. "Russell 2000" still cannot
   match "Russell 1000".
6. Scope: institution -> CRSP `mgmt_cd`, seeded ONLY from exact-tier siblings
   (`via_seriesid`/`via_ticker`/`via_l2_crsp_name`), then grown from the
   unscoped pass's own accepts. A mgmt_cd must carry >= L3B_SCOPE_MIN_SHARE of
   the institution's siblings: three of BlackRock's 823 sit under Allspring's
   code, and without that floor a BlackRock master matched an Allspring fund
   at 1.00.
7. CROSS-FAMILY VETO (hard gate, applied to CANDIDATES before the top-1 is
   chosen, so a vetoed candidate cannot crowd out a correct in-family one). A
   master's feeder is in the same family by construction. If the ISS side makes
   a family claim and that family is absent from the CRSP `fund_name` AND
   `mgmt_name`, the pair is vetoed regardless of score — UNLESS the target's
   management company is attested for this institution by its exact-tier
   (seriesId/ticker) siblings at >= L3B_SUCCESSION_MIN_SHARE, which is how a
   genuine corporate succession (Boston Management and Research -> Eaton Vance,
   Reich & Tang "CIT" -> Shelton, Gartmore -> Nationwide) is told from an error.
   The family-token test is evidence-based, not stoplist-based: a fund-name
   token counts only if some FIRM on one side is actually called that.
8. A name made entirely of strategy words ("REAL ESTATE", "SMALL CAP INDEX")
   carries no identity of its own, so it is accepted only with real ID-based
   scope support.
9. Accept: scoped needs score >= 0.97 and a strict margin over the runner-up
   CRSP fund; unscoped needs 0.97, margin >= 0.02 and a family bridge. There is
   no score-only path. The 0.97 bar is MEASURED — see the accept-rules banner
   the script prints, and LEARNINGS: at 0.90 the tier ran ~60% correct and every
   error was the right family and the wrong sibling, all scoring 0.907-0.923.

Precision is the binding constraint, not coverage: a mis-link imports another
fund's `index_fund_flag` (a block) and its `tna_latest` (a vote weight), and
L3 caught two 13-vote-row fundids inheriting Vanguard Total Stock Market's
$2.0T through exactly this kind of name match. VERIFY 4 prints the
TNA-per-vote-row tail for every link this tier adds.

Master-feeder TNA caveat, recorded not silently assumed: **a master's assets
are the SUM of its feeders'**, so linking a master to one feeder's CRSP record
gives it that feeder's TNA, which UNDERSTATES the master. Within-block relative
weight is what T3 consumes, so this biases the master's weight down; it never
inflates it. The direction of the error is the safe one, but it is an error.

    they must already appear in that fund's own trust prefix, on the ISS side in
    its own institution name.

    A reviewer asked for this to be removed, on the grounds that it caused the
    one cross-family error found in audit (BLACKROCK MASTER SMALL CAP GROWTH ->
    Allspring Small Company Growth, 0.911). The mechanism was right, the remedy
    is not: removing it costs 91 fundids / ~320K vote rows and loses 5 of the
    reviewer's own 10 reference matches, INCLUDING the largest ("S&P 500 Index
    Master Portfolio" -> BlackRock S&P 500 Index Fund, 67,320 vote rows). The
    Allspring error is killed instead by the CROSS-FAMILY RULE below, which is
    computed on the UNSTRIPPED ISS name and institution and on the unit's full
    trust-qualified CRSP name, so it bites whether or not a match came through a
    stripped form. See LEARNINGS.

print("""ACCEPT RULES — each clause is here because a hand audit measured the
failure it prevents. Two audit rounds; both are recorded in LEARNINGS.

 ROUND 1 (score bar 0.90, L2's accept logic reused verbatim): 6 of 20 correct.
  - The `core` space deletes FUND/PORTFOLIO/TRUST/SERIES on purpose, so short
    generic names collapse ("Small Company Fund" -> "SMALL FUND"). L2's unscoped
    second signal, "this name maps to exactly ONE corpus unit", INVERTS there: a
    real fund name ("US LARGE CAP VALUE") is shared by many units and is
    rejected, while a degenerate one that happens to be unique sails through.
    -> the score-only path is REMOVED, and a matched name must carry >= %d
       tokens (>= %d unscoped; >= %d only with scope AND family AND >= %.2f).
  - `family_agree` used the FIRST institution token after the stopwords: "JOHN"
    for John Hancock, "RS" for RS Investment Management.
    -> every institution token >= %d chars now counts (HANCOCK, DIMENSIONAL).

 ROUND 2 (those fixed, bar still 0.90): ~60%% correct, and EVERY error was the
 same shape -- right family, wrong sibling ("Preferred Income II" -> "Preferred
 Income ETF", "Small Company Value" -> "Small Cap Value") -- scoring 0.907-0.923
 while essentially every correct match scored >= 0.97.
    -> the bar is 0.97. This tier claims a master's name IS its feeder's name
       once structural words and the sponsor prefix are removed; that is an
       IDENTITY claim, so it is held to identity.

 scoped   : in the institution's CRSP management scope, score >= %.2f, margin
            >= %.3f over the runner-up CRSP FUND.
 unscoped : score >= %.2f, margin >= %.2f, AND a family bridge. No score-only path.
