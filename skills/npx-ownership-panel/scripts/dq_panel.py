"""dq_panel.py — run the ownership detectors against the panel this DAG just built.

WHY THIS IS A DAG JOB AND NOT A THING YOU REMEMBER TO DO.
SKILL.md says a timed run should include the detector sweep "so the number means
'a panel you can use'". Until now nothing in run_pipeline.sh referenced
ownership_dq.py at all, so every timing quoted for this pipeline was the time to
build a panel of unmeasured quality. The sweep costs seconds against a ~35 minute
DAG; leaving it out bought nothing and cost the one number that says the output is
usable.

IT REPORTS, IT DOES NOT GATE. No detector count fails this job. The thresholds in
ownership_dq.py belong to whoever set them and are not this script's to enforce,
and a panel with a known 3.1% impossible-ratio rate is still the panel you meant
to build. What would be wrong is not knowing.

The summary prints in the same shape as the PREREQ / UNIVERSE / OPTIONAL gate
lines, so one grep covers the lot:

    grep -E 'PREREQ|UNIVERSE|OPTIONAL|DQ|ERROR' logs/*.log

ownership_dq.py IS NOT DUPLICATED HERE. It lives in the `wrds` skill and
SKILL.md says, in as many words, "Deliberately not duplicated here." So this
resolves it rather than carrying a third copy that can drift. Resolution order:

    $OWNERSHIP_DQ                                  explicit wins
    ../../wrds/scripts/ownership_dq.py             the repo layout
    ./ownership_dq.py                              deployed alongside

If none resolve the job fails LOUDLY with the remedy. It is the last job in the
DAG and holds nothing, so failing here costs a message, not a panel.
