# DOCX Repair (Google Docs / Word Online damage)

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Cloud editors damage a `.docx` in **independent ways**. This skill is the front door for all of them; run only the track(s) you need.

| Damage class | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Package / OOXML wiring** | Word pops "recover unreadable content?" or refuses to open; LibreOffice won't load; phantom blank page | `scripts/docx_repair.py` (plugin root) — [references/package-repair.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/package-repair.md) |
| **B. Footnote & cross-reference markup** | Bios show `1,2,3` not `*,†,‡`; numbering starts wrong; "supra note N" points to the wrong footnote; missing separator line | the footnote scripts — [references/footnote-procedure.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/footnote-procedure.md) |
| **B1. Cross-references aimed at the wrong source** | `Lin, supra note 130` where note 130 is a different work; `Rebuttal Report, supra note 22` where 22 defines the deposition; a short form surviving a renumber that moved its target | `check_crossrefs.py <file.docx>` — read-only, exit 1 on any problem |
| **C. Document content (boxes + headings + cruft)** | Visible **boxes** around freshly-edited text; heading-looking lines not styled as headings; same-style headings rendering differently; blank heading lines; bloated XML full of all-zero rsids, no-op shading, explicit `b=0`/`i=0`/`u=none`, redundant black color & default fonts | `fix_footnotes.py`'s document.xml passes — [references/content-cleanup.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/content-cleanup.md) |
| **D. Presentation hygiene** | A footnote renders blue/underlined in the PDF but looks normal in Word; a URL prints one address and navigates to another; heading gaps uneven page to page; tracking params (`?utm_source=…`) behind a clean-looking link | `docx_links.py`, `docx_spacers.py` — [references/presentation-hygiene.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/presentation-hygiene.md) |

They are decoupled: package repair fixes the **part wiring** (never touches content); footnote repair fixes the **footnote markup**; content cleanup strips Google-Docs leftover content controls and normalizes headings. A file can need any, all, or none. If you don't know which, run the package check first (it's a no-op on a clean package), then the footnote pass (it carries the content cleanup).

> Heads-up: `docx-render`'s Word path already composes `docx_repair.py` as a preflight, so a Google export "just renders" without a manual Track A. Run Track A manually when you need the *repaired file itself* (to hand back, edit, or footnote-fix), not just a PDF.

## Reference index — read the file for the track you are running

All procedural detail lives in `references/`. Read only what the job needs.

- [references/package-repair.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/package-repair.md)
  — **Track A.** The two concrete Google Docs export defects (case-mismatched
  `customXML`/`customXml` OPC part references; leftover `<w:evenAndOddHeaders/>`),
  and the CLI + Python API for `scripts/docx_repair.py` at plugin root.
  **Read when** Word calls the file corrupt, refuses to open it, or shows a
  phantom blank page — or before handing back a repaired file rather than a PDF.

- [references/footnote-procedure.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/footnote-procedure.md)
  — **Track B, the canonical procedure.** The exact four-step order for a Google
  Docs round-trip (accept changes → `fix_footnotes.py` → `create_crossrefs.py
  --baseline` → render with Word), what to verify in the render, the
  incident-grounded procedure facts (why step 3 must follow step 2, why
  `--baseline` is not optional, why LibreOffice lies), the list of symptoms
  footnote repair applies to, and the quick-start "which script do I want?"
  routing. **Read when** running any footnote repair — start here.

- [references/footnote-scripts.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/footnote-scripts.md)
  — **Track B, script detail.** Per-script behaviour and every flag for
  `fix_footnotes.py`, `create_crossrefs.py` (including how `--baseline` remaps
  stale numbers) and `refresh_noteref_caches.py` (why the naive approaches fail,
  its requirements and intentional scope), plus the footnote numbering-offset fix
  (`numRestart`). **Read when** you need a specific flag, or the exact semantics
  of one of the three scripts.

- [references/footnotes-reference.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/footnotes-reference.md)
  — **Track B, OOXML technical reference.** (1) Run-level editing gotchas (NBSP,
  cross-run matching, `xml:space`); (2) cloud editor damage patterns — what gets
  destroyed and why; (3) direct ZIP surgery patterns that bypass Document
  libraries; (4) the numbering-restart details and the critical rule that
  `numRestart` goes in `settings.xml` ONLY. **Read when** hand-editing footnote
  XML or debugging behaviour the scripts do not cover.

- [references/content-cleanup.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/content-cleanup.md)
  — **Track C.** The four content passes `fix_footnotes.py` carries: stripping
  `goog_rdk` content controls (the "boxes", default on), heading normalization
  (`--normalize-headings`), the OOXML hygiene / de-cruft rules (default on, with
  the exact strip/keep lists), body-indent normalization
  (`--normalize-body-indent`), and applying the template's body styles
  (`--restyle-body`), plus the content-cleanup incident facts. **Read when**
  boxes, inconsistent headings, stray indents or XML bloat are the complaint, or
  before passing any of those flags.

- [references/presentation-hygiene.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-repair/references/presentation-hygiene.md)
  — **Track D.** `docx_links.py` (tracking-param stripping, SSRN canonicalization,
  footnote hyperlink unwrapping — and why display text and relationship `Target`
  must both be rewritten) and `docx_spacers.py` (manual spacer removal, why a
  text-empty paragraph may not be empty, the title-page collapse hazard), plus why
  both edit bytes rather than the ElementTree tree. **Read when** the PDF shows
  blue/underlined footnotes, a link that navigates elsewhere, or uneven heading
  gaps.

## Related (document skill group)

This skill owns the **REPAIR** stage — package wiring (Track A), footnote
markup (Track B), and document-content cleanup (Track C) — for a `.docx` damaged
by a cloud editor. Adjacent stages:

- **Build** a styled `.docx` from markdown → `law-review-docx` (its `build_docx.py`
  chains this skill's footnote repair + NOTEREF conversion after the pandoc build).
- **Render** to PDF/PNG → `docx-render` / `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doc_render.py` (Word path composes
  Track A's `docx_repair.py` as a preflight automatically).
- **Check cross-references before believing them.** `check_crossrefs.py` is the only
  pass that READS the target note: it verifies the short form names a source the
  target actually contains, on top of existence and direction. `create_crossrefs.py
  --dry-run` proves only that note N exists and will report "25 targets, 25 valid"
  over a document whose cites point at the wrong documents — it is a conversion
  preflight, not an audit. Run `check_crossrefs.py` on any draft returned by a
  coauthor, and after every renumber. It name-matches loosely (any capitalised word
  in the short form appearing in the target), so it catches a cite aimed at the wrong
  source, never a wrong pincite.
- **Footnote repair lives only here.** `fix_footnotes.py` is the single canonical
  Google-Docs / Word-Online footnote fixer; there is no second copy. (Bluebook's
  `create_crossrefs.py` + `audit_crossref_targets.py` remain a deliberate,
  actively-used *cross-reference* fork with their own retargeting strategy — a
  different concern, not a footnote-fix duplicate.)
