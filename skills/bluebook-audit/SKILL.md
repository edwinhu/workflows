# Bluebook Footnote Audit Workflow

**What this skill carries.** The names and headings are the index; for a subject none of
them carries, `grep -il <term> ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/*.md`.

!`skill-toc ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`

Systematic Bluebook 21st edition compliance audit for law review manuscripts in DOCX format.

**Announce:** "Using bluebook-audit to run a systematic Bluebook compliance check."

## Overview

Seven-phase linear workflow: Extract -> Check -> Report -> Correct -> Verify -> Archive -> Cross-Refs

```
/bluebook-audit  -> extract -> check -> report -> [USER REVIEWS] -> correct -> verify -> archive -> crossrefs
/bluebook-audit-fix -> diagnose -> route to {re-check, re-correct, re-verify}
```

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Responsibility | Gate |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Extract | Parse DOCX -> structured JSON with formatting | `footnotes_data.json` exists, all FNs extracted |
| Check | Mechanical checks → Gemini Batch per-footnote → Claude cross-footnote review | `audit_findings.json` exists, ALL FNs covered, three-layer merge complete |
| Report | Present findings to user for review | `AUDIT_REPORT.md` exists, user acknowledges |
| Correct | Apply fixes to DOCX via lxml | Corrected DOCX exists, fix counts match |
| Verify | Re-scan to confirm fixes applied | Zero remaining issues in re-scan |
| Archive | perma.cc URL archiving | All URLs archived, links written to DOCX |
| Cross-Refs | Convert supra/infra notes to NOTEREF fields | All cross-refs are auto-updating fields |

## How to Start

1. User provides a DOCX file path
2. Workflow creates `scratch/` directory for intermediate artifacts
3. Proceeds through phases sequentially

## Iron Law: ALL Footnotes Must Be Checked

**Every footnote in the document must be audited. No subsets. No sampling.**

Auditing only "major-severity" footnotes or a random sample guarantees missed errors. The formatted Gemini audit must cover ALL footnotes, not just previously flagged ones.

Skipping footnotes is NOT HELPFUL — missed errors go to publication and embarrass the user.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## Iron Law: Formatted Text for Gemini Audit

**NEVER send plain text to Gemini for typeface auditing. Always include formatting markup.**

Plain text produces 10-20x false positives because Gemini cannot see what is already italic/small caps/roman. Inline markup (`*italic*`, `[SC]small caps[/SC]`) reduces false positives from ~400 to ~20 for a 239-footnote document — measured on gemini-2.5-flash, so on the current `judgment` role it is an estimate, not a measurement.

## Iron Law: Verify After Corrections

**After applying corrections, ALWAYS re-run the scanner to verify fixes were applied.**

NBSP characters, run boundaries, and cross-run text cause silent failures. A fix that "applied" in code may not have actually changed the DOCX. Re-scanning is mandatory.

## Iron Law: Mechanical Findings Override Gemini

**Never drop a mechanical finding because Gemini didn't flag it.**

Deterministic checks (signal italic, terminal periods, Id. chains) are 100% reliable. Gemini misses ~30% of signal formatting issues because it focuses on citation-level analysis and lacks a dedicated signal-checking output field. During merge/dedup, mechanical findings are authoritative for their rule categories. Gemini adds value only for judgment calls (source type classification, abbreviation tables).

Previous failure: Gemini reported FN103 as having only typeface issues on article titles, completely missing that "See also" was not italicized — which the mechanical checker caught.

## Iron Law: Source Type Classification Requires Human Review

**Gemini consistently misclassifies non-standard source types. Never auto-fix Gemini's typeface suggestions for SEC releases, executive orders, working papers, or regulatory materials.**

The hardest part of a Bluebook audit is determining the correct typeface for non-standard sources. Gemini defaults to "everything should be italic or small caps" but many source types are correctly roman:
- SEC releases/rules/concept releases → roman (regulatory material, Rule 14.6)
- Executive order titles → roman (Rule 14.7)
- Working paper series designations → roman (parenthetical)
- Company names in no-action letters → roman

The audit report MUST separate "verified fixes" (clear violations) from "judgment calls" (source type dependent) and include a "correct as-is" section documenting why Gemini's suggestions were rejected. See `references/audit-patterns.md` for the full source type reference table.

Previous failure: Gemini flagged 10+ items as needing italic/small caps that were actually correct as roman (SEC releases, exec orders, working paper designations). Without the source type reference table, these would have been incorrectly "fixed."

## Audit Facts

- Gemini hallucinates citation formats and fabricates citation details. Its output is a lead sheet, not a verdict — run the mechanical checker independently, merge results, and spot-check before applying anything. A Gemini suggestion applied unverified is an unverified claim applied as a fix.
- Fixes cascade: a correction in one phase creates new errors in dependent phases, and every phase catches a different error type. Re-run the affected scanner after every correction pass — "earlier phases were clean" says nothing about errors the fixes just introduced.
- A hardcoded journal list and a previously-extracted `sources.bib` are both LAGGING records, and each one hid real errors in the same document: `J. Corp. L.` was not in `JOURNAL_NAMES`, and 19 of 53 article cites were missing from a bib extracted four months earlier. Validating a manuscript against either has the dependency backwards — it hides precisely the citations most recently reworked, which are the ones most likely to be wrong. Run `bib_gaps.py` BEFORE the small-caps check so the bib is current when the check reads it.
- The bib's `journal` field only exists on `@article` entries, so it covers article periodicals and nothing else — 23 of one document's 54 small-capped names were newspapers, magazines, blogs and BOOK titles, which live in `@misc`/`@book`. Treating "scan the bib" as complete coverage silently exempts every book and newspaper in the manuscript.
- One wrong supra reference invalidates the reader's trust in ALL footnotes. Sampling, eyeballing, or marking a footnote correct without checking the reporter/volume audits a subset and asserts compliance for the whole — a claim the audit never verified. Every footnote, every phase, regardless of document length.

## Delete & Restart

**If you sent plain text to Gemini instead of formatted text with footnote markers, DELETE the results and START OVER with properly formatted input.** Gemini cannot audit what it cannot parse.
