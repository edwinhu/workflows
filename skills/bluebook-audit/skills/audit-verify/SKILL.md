# Phase 5: Verify

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Re-scan the corrected DOCX to confirm all fixes were applied and no new issues were introduced.

## What This Phase Does

1. Re-extract all footnotes from the corrected DOCX
2. Re-run mechanical checks (small caps scanner, signal checker, etc.)
3. Compare findings against the original audit - all flagged issues should now be clean
4. Report any remaining issues

## Verification Checks

1. **Formatting scanner**: Re-run `scan_formatting.py --docx corrected.docx` - expect 0 findings (or only known false positives like "Institutional Investors" in titles)
2. **Cross-reference check**: All `[_]` placeholders should be resolved
3. **Signal formatting**: All signals should be italic
4. **Terminal periods**: All footnotes should end with periods
5. **Id. chains**: All id. references should have single-source predecessors
6. **Gemini re-audit on fixed footnotes**: Re-run `gemini_audit.py --subset [all previously flagged FNs]` to catch issues introduced by fixes or missed in the initial pass

### Re-Scan Catches Real Issues

In the "Other People's Votes" audit, the Gemini re-scan on fixed footnotes caught a Wells Fargo press release title (FN206) that wasn't in the original "judgment call" list — it was in the same footnote as other fixes but wasn't flagged initially. The verify phase is not ceremonial; it finds real issues.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## Iron Law: Re-Scan Is Not Optional

The verify phase MUST re-run the scanner on the corrected DOCX. Skipping verification was the root cause of missing 41 small caps fixes in the original audit.

If the re-scan finds issues, go back to Correct phase. Do NOT proceed to Archive with unresolved issues.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Red Flags

- Skipping the re-scan because "all fixes applied" → run the scanner; silent fix failures are common.
- Dismissing remaining findings as false positives → investigate each one; some "false positives" are real.
- Proceeding to Archive with >0 real issues → fix them first; uncorrected issues persist forever.

## Gate: Exit Verify

Before proceeding to Archive phase:
- [ ] Re-scan completed on corrected DOCX
- [ ] Zero remaining issues (or all remaining are confirmed false positives)
- [ ] If issues found: returned to Correct phase and re-verified

## Next Phase

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../../../skills/bluebook-audit/skills/audit-archive/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.
