# Phase 3: Report

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Generate a human-readable audit report and present to the user for review before applying corrections.

## What This Phase Does

1. Merge three-layer findings: mechanical + Gemini per-footnote + Claude cross-footnote review (**mechanical > Claude > Gemini priority** — see audit-check merge rules)
2. Categorize by issue type and severity
3. Flag items needing manual review (low-confidence cross-refs, ambiguous citations)
4. Generate `scratch/AUDIT_REPORT.md`
5. Present summary to user

### Three-Layer Merge Priority

**Mechanical > Claude cross-review > Gemini per-footnote**

- Mechanical findings (signal italic, terminal periods, Id. chains, small caps patterns) are deterministic and **must never be dropped**
- Claude cross-review adds cross-footnote patterns (supra chains, hereinafter consistency) and filters Gemini false positives
- Gemini per-footnote adds individual source type classification and abbreviation checks

## Report Structure

```markdown
# Bluebook Audit Report

## Summary
- Total footnotes: N
- Clean: N (XX%)
- Issues found: N across M footnotes

## Fix Counts by Category
| Category | Count | Auto-fixable |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Journal name small caps | N | Yes |
| Book title small caps | N | Yes |
| Cross-reference resolution | N | Yes (high confidence) |
| Id. chain errors | N | Partial |
| Signal formatting | N | Yes |
| Terminal periods | N | Yes |
| Typeface errors (other) | N | Manual |

## Issues by Footnote
[sorted by footnote number]

## Items Needing Manual Review
[low-confidence cross-refs, ambiguous citations, judgment calls]

## Correct As-Is (Gemini False Positives)
[Items Gemini flagged but are actually correct, with reasoning]
[Group by source type: SEC releases (roman), exec orders (roman), etc.]
[Reference: audit-patterns.md Source Type Typeface Reference table]
```

### Why "Correct As-Is" Matters

Many Gemini suggestions are wrong — especially for non-standard source types (SEC releases, exec orders, working paper designations). Documenting WHY these are correct:
1. Prevents re-flagging if someone re-runs the audit
2. Forces the reviewer to consciously evaluate each judgment call
3. Creates a record of the source type classification decisions

## Gate: Exit Report

This is a **user gate**. The workflow pauses here.

- [ ] `scratch/AUDIT_REPORT.md` exists
- [ ] User has reviewed the report
- [ ] User approves proceeding to corrections

**Do NOT proceed to corrections without user acknowledgment.**

## Next Phase

After user approval:
Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../../../skills/bluebook-audit/skills/audit-correct/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.
