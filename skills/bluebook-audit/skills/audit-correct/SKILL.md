# Phase 4: Correct

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Apply approved corrections to the DOCX file via lxml XML manipulation.

## What This Phase Does

1. Back up the original DOCX
2. Apply corrections in order:
   a. Cross-reference resolution (fill `[_]` placeholders)
   b. Small caps for journal/periodical names (run-splitting)
   c. Small caps for book titles (italic -> small caps)
   d. Signal italic fixes
   e. Id. chain corrections
   f. Terminal period additions
   g. Other typeface fixes
3. Write corrected DOCX

## Run-Splitting Approach

When formatting a substring within a larger run:
1. Find the run containing the target text
2. Split into 3 runs: prefix (original) + target (new format) + suffix (original)
3. Clone `rPr` from original run via `deepcopy`
4. Add new formatting only to target run
5. Set `xml:space="preserve"` on all `<w:t>` elements

## Critical Gotchas

### NBSP Variants
All search operations MUST handle `\xa0` (non-breaking space):
```python
def find_in_run(text, target):
    if target in text:
        return text.find(target)
    nbsp_target = target.replace(' ', '\xa0')
    if nbsp_target in text:
        return text.find(nbsp_target)
    # Try regex with [\s\xa0] for mixed
    import re
    pattern = re.escape(target).replace(r'\ ', r'[\s\xa0]')
    m = re.search(pattern, text)
    return m.start() if m else -1
```

### footnoteRef Space Run Bug
The run after `<w:footnoteRef/>` often contains the full footnote text, not just a space. When replacing entire footnote content, keep ONLY the footnoteRef run and add an explicit space run.

### Cross-Run Text
`supra note 10` spans italic + roman runs. Target the specific run containing the text you need to change (e.g., just "note 10" in the roman run).

### Multi-Split Footnotes
Some footnotes need multiple formatting changes in the same run (e.g., FN91: italic the letter title AND small-caps the annual report title, both in one roman run). Process splits **sequentially left-to-right**:
1. First split creates 3 new runs from the original
2. Second split finds target text in one of the NEW runs and splits again
3. The `find_run()` search re-scans the footnote element each time, so it finds the new runs

Example: `Jamie Dimon, Chairman & CEO Letter to Shareholders, in JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2023 Annual Report 1 (2024)`
- Split 1: "Chairman & CEO Letter to Shareholders" → italic (creates 3 runs)
- Split 2: "JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2023 Annual Report" → small caps (splits the third run from Split 1)

### Italic Spillover Cleanup
After all substantive fixes, clean up trailing/leading spaces in italic runs. Word displays these fine, but they cause Gemini annotation issues on re-audit:
```python
# Find italic runs with trailing spaces
if text.endswith(' ') and is_italic:
    t.text = text.rstrip(' ')
    # Insert a new roman space run after
```

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## Iron Law: Verify Every Fix

After each category of corrections, verify the fix was applied by reading back the modified XML. Silent failures from NBSP, run boundaries, or wrong-run targeting are common.

Skipping read-back verification is NOT HELPFUL — silent failures from NBSP or run boundaries mean the user's document still has errors.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Correction Facts

- NBSP characters and run boundaries cause silent failures and wrong-run targeting — code that "applied" is not code that worked. A fix reported without XML read-back is an unverified claim presented as a correction.
- Verification batched to the end can't attribute a failure to the fix that caused it; verify after each category.
- Every footnote has a unique run structure — a pattern that worked on the last footnote proves nothing about this one.
- One XML corruption destroys the whole document; skipping the backup gambles the user's manuscript to save seconds.

## Gate: Exit Correct

Before proceeding to Verify phase:
- [ ] Backup DOCX exists (original preserved)
- [ ] Corrected DOCX exists
- [ ] Per-category fix counts logged
- [ ] Spot-check verification passed (at least 5 random fixes checked)

## Next Phase

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../../../skills/bluebook-audit/skills/audit-verify/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.
