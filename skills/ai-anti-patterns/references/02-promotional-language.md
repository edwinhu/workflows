LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage"—in which case they will constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.

**Examples**

> Nestled within the ==breathtaking== region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo ==stands as a vibrant town== with a ==rich cultural heritage and a significant place== within the Amhara region. From its ==scenic landscapes== to its ==historical landmarks==, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a ==fascinating glimpse== into the ==diverse tapestry== of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the ==unique characteristics== that make Alamata Raya Kobo ==a town worth visiting== and shed light on ==its significance== within the Amhara region.

LLMs often tell the reader about things "it's important to remember." This frequently happens in the context of "disclaimers" to an imagined reader, often regarding safety or topics that vary in different locales/jurisdictions. It seems to be more common in text by older (pre-2025) chatbots.

**Examples**

> The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. ==However, it's important to note ==that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions ==may vary==.====
