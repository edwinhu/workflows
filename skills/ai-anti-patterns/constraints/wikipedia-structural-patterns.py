# wikipedia-puffery-and-exaggeration.py. Its paragraph-start filler transitions and its broader
# `Despite X,` formula had no counterpart here and were merged in below, marked `[ex-ai-smell]`.
# NOTE ON ANCHORING — THIS IS A DELIBERATE WIDENING, NOT AN OVERSIGHT. ai-smell fired only on a
# PARAGRAPH-start line, tracked with its own stateful prose scanner. These tables are matched line
# by line by every loader, so `^` here means LINE start, and in a hard-wrapped draft a sentence
# beginning "Moreover," or "Despite its success," mid-paragraph will now fire where it did not
# before. Accepted for two reasons: a filler transition is a filler transition wherever the
# sentence starts (Volokh would cut it either way), and the whole module is SEVERITY = "soft", so
# the cost of the extra hits is an advisory line, never a blocked gate. If the noise proves real,
# the fix is a paragraph-aware runner shared by every table — not a second stateful scanner.
