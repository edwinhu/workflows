# Watch every farm-out run in this session. One line per milestone.
#
# Declared in monitors/monitors.json as `on-skill-invoke:farm-out`, so it starts
# the first time the skill is dispatched and runs for the session. It takes NO
# arguments — a plugin monitor's command is fixed — so it watches a conventional
# directory instead of a log path a caller passes.
#
# The directory is under TMPDIR, not the repo, and is keyed by CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
# — TMPDIR alone is per-USER, so without that key every concurrent session's runs
# land in one directory and each monitor reports the others' milestones and kill -0's
# pids it does not own.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT `tail -F`: silence has to be distinguishable from death. A
# tail is equally quiet whether a farm is thinking or was killed, and a watch that
# greps only success signatures says nothing in both cases. This reports the
# farm's own milestones AND notices a run whose process is gone without a DONE.
