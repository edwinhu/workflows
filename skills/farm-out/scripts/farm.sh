# CLI runner: delegate to a CLIProxyAPI wrapper in a separate process.
#
# THIS IS THE ONLY RUNNER. It replaced an Agent-SDK runner that shelled the
# wrapper ONLY for `--settings-json`, harvested its env, then reimplemented the
# client that wrapper already is. That runner was deleted 2026-08-23; craft
# dispatch and re-dispatch both come here. Two reasons it went, both measured
# 2026-08-22:
#
#   * The SDK's `options.agent` applies an agent's tool restrictions and model
#     but NOT its system prompt. Asked whether it carried the DS constraints,
#     an SDK child under `agent: "ds"` answered "NOT PRESENT"; `claude-code -p
#     --agent ds` quoted the preload sentence back. So the SDK path silently
#     narrows the toolset and delivers none of the persona.
#   * An SDK child is a bare query() — no Agent tool, no Workflow tool. A
#     `-p` child is a full Claude Code session and has both, so a farmed run
#     can fan out further. FARM_OUT_CHILD=1 already exempts it from
#     main-thread-guard.
#
# Invoking the wrapper directly also deletes the env-harvesting layer: the
# wrapper sets its own environment. What is kept, because it is the only
# load-bearing logic in the SDK runner, is the anti-simulation clause and
# artifact verification.
#
