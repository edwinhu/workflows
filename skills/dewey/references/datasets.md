# Dewey Featured Datasets & Institutional Access

## Institutional access (UVA / NYU)

Dewey sells a **Platform Subscription** at the institution level. One subscription unlocks the whole catalog — you don't license vendors individually (the WRDS pain point).

- **UVA Library** holds the institutional subscription. Log in at `app.deweydata.io` via **NetBadge** using your **UVA email**.
- **NYU** also subscribes (NYU SSO).
- Under the institutional license, **SafeGraph and most providers are free**. A few are flagged **institutional-license-only** (e.g. **Veraset** device-level movement, **ATTOM** property) — these are still included but governed by stricter terms.
- Check coverage at `docs.deweydata.io/docs/subscribed-universities`.

After logging in, mint an **API key** (Connections → Add Connection → API Key) and get each dataset's **product path** (Get Data → Connect to API). See SKILL.md "Authentication".

## Discovery

Don't hardcode dataset names — they change and have versioned releases. Discover via:
- **MCP** (`search_datasets` / `semantically_search_datasets` / `list_data_partners`) — see `mcp.md`.
- The web catalog at `app.deweydata.io` (filter by category/provider, "Discover Data" lets you sample before subscribing).

Then capture the **product path / `prj_` id** from *Get Data → Connect to API / Bulk API* for the scripted pull.
