# tuicr — TUI Code Review

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Review a PR (or the working tree, a commit range, or a file) with inline annotations in the tuicr
TUI, then read the annotations back and address them. tuicr auto-detects the VCS. Unlike a one-way
capture tool, tuicr **persists the review session to disk** and exposes it to agents both ways:
Claude *reads* your notes with `tuicr review comments` and can *write* replies back into the same
session — that you see live in the TUI — with `tuicr review add`.

## Activation Triggers

- "tuicr", "review PR with tuicr", "tuicr pr 70", "review PR #123", "review this PR"
- "review the working tree", "review changes with tuicr", "tuicr working tree"
- "review commit range", "tuicr -r main..HEAD"
- "tuicr all files", "browse all files"
- "tuicr README.md", "tuicr docs/plan.md", "review this file with tuicr" — single-file review (`--file`)
- "address my tuicr annotations", "read my tuicr review", "what did I annotate in tuicr" — process an existing session
- "tuicr config", "tuicr keybindings", "how do tuicr sessions work" — informational

## Answering Questions

If the user asks *about* tuicr (config, sessions, keybindings, install) rather than requesting a
review, consult the reference files and answer directly — do **not** launch the TUI.

- `references/install.md` — how tuicr is installed (nixpkgs) and the launcher
- `references/config.md` — config file, themes, session storage
- `references/usage.md` — commands, keybindings, the agent read/write JSON contract

## Using an Existing Session

If the user says "read my tuicr review", "address the annotations I just made", "what did I flag" —
they ran tuicr outside this flow and want the stored annotations processed. Skip the launch: resolve
the session slug (Step 3) and go straight to Step 3.5 classification.

## How It Works

1. Launch tuicr in **its own herdr tab** (it needs a real TTY), revealed once the diff has painted.
2. The user navigates the diff and adds inline annotations (`c`), then quits (`q`).
3. On quit, the launcher unblocks. Annotations live in the persisted session on disk — NOT on stdout.
4. Claude reads them with `tuicr review comments --session <slug>`, classifies, and addresses each.
5. Optionally Claude replies into the session with `tuicr review add` (stamped as the agent).
6. Loop: re-launch so the user can see fixes and add more; done when there are no new annotations.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Verify Installation

```bash
command -v tuicr && tuicr --version
herdr tab list       # the launcher hosts the TUI in a herdr tab; this confirms a live server
```

If missing, tuicr is in nixpkgs — add `tuicr` to `~/nix/modules/shared/packages.nix` and rebuild
(`cd ~/nix && nix run .#build-switch`), or for a one-off run set
`TUICR=$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths nixpkgs#tuicr)/bin/tuicr`. See `references/install.md`.

### Step 1: Determine the Review Target

Map `$ARGUMENTS` to tuicr's flags (always append `--no-update-check`):

| User intent | tuicr args |
|---|---|
| PR number `70` / PR or MR URL | `pr 70` (run from inside the repo, or pass the URL) |
| "working tree" / uncommitted | `-w` |
| commit range / revset | `-r <revset>` (e.g. `-r main..HEAD`) |
| "all files" | `-A` |
| a file/dir path (`docs/plan.md`) | `--file docs/plan.md` |
| a PR, narrowed to one path | `pr 70 --path src/app.rs` |

If nothing is specified and the repo has uncommitted changes, default to `-w`; on a clean feature
branch, offer `-r <main>..HEAD`. Ask only when genuinely ambiguous.

### Step 2: Launch the Review

The launcher opens tuicr in a new **herdr tab** (labeled `tuicr`), and blocks until the user quits.
The tab is created *unfocused* and revealed only once tuicr has painted, so it appears already
loaded rather than as a blank shell. Run it in the repo directory:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/launch-tuicr.sh" pr 70 --no-update-check
```

**IMPORTANT — long-running command**: it blocks for the whole review. Set the Bash tool `timeout`
to the maximum your harness allows (e.g. `1800000`). Do **not** use `run_in_background`. On a clean
quit the launcher prints `TUICR_RC=0`.

- tuicr needs a real TTY, so the launcher runs it in a fresh herdr pane (`herdr tab create` +
  `herdr pane run`) — running tuicr inline or with the `!` prefix fails with `No such device or
  address (os error 6)`. Always go through the launcher.
- The review lands in its own tab, so it never takes over the tab Claude is in. When the user quits
  tuicr (`q`), the launcher returns and closes the review tab.
- ghostty is only a **fallback**, used when no herdr server is reachable (or `jq` is missing). Don't
  assume ghostty is installed — herdr is the supported path.
- Launcher exit codes: `1` = tuicr not on PATH, `2` = no herdr server *and* no ghostty.

**If the Bash tool times out** before the launcher returns, tuicr is still open. Do NOT relaunch.
Tell the user "let me know when you've quit tuicr", then continue at Step 3 once they reply.

### Step 3: Read the Annotations

Resolve the session slug for what you just reviewed, then read its comments:

```bash
# slug for the most-recently-updated session in this repo (PR slugs look like gh:owner/repo/pr/70):
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve-session.sh"            # newest session for the cwd repo
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve-session.sh" 70         # narrow to a PR number

tuicr review comments --session "gh:edwinhu/workflows/pr/70"
```

`tuicr review comments` prints a clean JSON array. Each item carries `path`, `start_line`,
`end_line`, `side` (`new`/`old`), `comment_type`, `lifecycle_state` (`local_draft` for un-exported
notes), and `content`. An empty array (`[]`) means the user quit without annotating → go to Step 7.
See `references/usage.md` for the exact schema.

### Step 3.5: Classify Annotations

Split each annotation's `content` into two buckets (case-insensitive):

- **Explanation request** — contains `??` (two or more `?`) anywhere, OR starts with `explain`,
  `remind`, `describe`, `what is`, `what are`, `how does`, `how do`, `clarify`. The user wants an
  answer, not a code change.
- **Code-change directive** — everything else.

**For explanation requests:** answer each (read the referenced code, write a clear explanation) and
reply into the session so the answer shows up in the TUI next to the note:

```bash
tuicr review add --session "<slug>" --username "Claude Opus 4.8" --type note \
  --target-file src/app.rs --line 42 --side new "Explanation: this mutex guards the write path because …"
```

Then relaunch (Step 6) so the user can read the reply and follow up. Carry any code-change
directives from the same batch forward to Step 4.

**If all annotations are code-change directives**, go straight to Step 4.

### Step 4: Plan Changes

Enter plan mode (EnterPlanMode). List each code-change annotation with its `path:line` and the
change you propose. Get approval before editing code.

### Step 5: Address Annotations

After approval, edit the source. Each annotation is a directive — fix the actual code at
`path`/`start_line`.

### Step 5.5: (Optional) Reply Into the Session

When a reply is useful (you deviated from the request, or want to note what you did), write it back
so it appears in the TUI, stamped as the agent:

```bash
tuicr review add --session "<slug>" --username "Claude Opus 4.8" --type note \
  --target-file src/app.rs --line 42 --side new "Done — switched to errors.Is(); kept the wrap for context."
```

Use `--type suggestion` for a concrete proposed edit, `--type note` for a comment. Omit
`--target-file/--line` for a review-level note. There is **no** `review remove` subcommand — to
delete a draft you added, edit the session JSON directly (path is in `tuicr review list`).

### Step 6: Loop

Relaunch with the same target so the user sees the fixes and can add more annotations:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/launch-tuicr.sh" pr 70 --no-update-check
```

Read the session again (Step 3). New annotations → back to Step 3.5. No new annotations → Step 7.

> **Fact — for a PR review, do NOT `git push` the PR branch until the review loop is done.**
> tuicr keys a PR session by the PR's current `head_sha`. Pushing new commits moves the head, so the
> next `tuicr pr <N>` opens a *fresh* session and the prior annotations + your replies are orphaned
> (the data survives in the old `sessions/*.json` but is unlinked from `pr <N>` — the user just sees
> an empty review). Local commits are safe; only **pushing** moves the head. So relaunch to show
> replies, gather follow-ups, and close the loop *first*; push once. Telling the user their notes are
> "in the TUI" after a push, when the reopen shows nothing, is worse than not replying at all.

### Step 7: Done

When `tuicr review comments` returns `[]` (or only notes you already addressed), the review is
complete. Tell the user. If they want to publish, tuicr can export to GitHub or the clipboard from
the TUI (or `--stdout` to print) — see `references/usage.md`.

## Example Session

```
User: "review PR 70 with tuicr"
→ launch-tuicr.sh pr 70 --no-update-check   (opens tuicr in a new herdr tab, focused)
→ user annotates handler.rs:43 "use errors.Is() instead of ==", quits
→ resolve-session.sh 70 → gh:edwinhu/workflows/pr/70
→ tuicr review comments --session gh:edwinhu/workflows/pr/70 → [{path:"handler.rs",start_line:43,content:"use errors.Is()…"}]
→ classify: code-change directive
→ plan mode: "handler.rs:43 — replace == with errors.Is()"; user approves
→ edit handler.rs
→ tuicr review add --session … --username "Claude Opus 4.8" --target-file handler.rs --line 43 "Done — errors.Is()."
→ relaunch pr 70 → user sees fix + reply, quits without new annotations
→ review complete
```
