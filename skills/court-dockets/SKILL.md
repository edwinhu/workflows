# Court dockets: retrieving filings from Lex Machina, Docket Alarm and Bloomberg Law

**What this skill carries.** The names and headings are the index; for a subject none of
them carries, `grep -il <term> ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/*.md`.

!`skill-toc ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`

Three commercial platforms, one job: turn a list of cases into a directory of PDFs plus a manifest
you can defend. Verified end to end on 1,597 Delaware Chancery cases, 2026-08-30/31 — ~4,000
documents retrieved across all three.

**Auth is the user's live browser session on CDP 9222.** None of these needs a password. Read the
cookie with `scripts/lm_cookie.py`; never log in, and never touch stored credentials unless the
user explicitly says to.

Full endpoint chains, request/response shapes and per-vendor quirks:
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/endpoints.md` — read it before writing any fetch code.

## The scripts are the interface

Do not hand-roll a harvester. These are working, resumable and manifest-writing:

| script | does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/lm_cookie.py` | reads the live session cookie for any host over CDP |
| `scripts/harvest_complaints.py` | Lex Machina: docket-search → tag-257 complaint → signed PDF |
| `scripts/da_grab.py` | Docket Alarm: serial, boring, survives hanging documents |
| `scripts/fetch_opinion_pdfs.py` | opinion/decision PDFs from a plan parquet |

Copy them into the project and adapt. Rewriting from the reference doc reproduces bugs that took
hours to find.

## The Iron Law of Identification vs Retrieval

**A document that is IDENTIFIED is not a document that is RETRIEVED. Never mark a substitute `ok`.**

Every vendor names the complaint far more often than it serves the file. Measured on the same
1,597 cases: Lex identified 99.6% and served 81.0%; Docket Alarm identified 96.4% and served
81.7%. A fallback that takes "the first document that has a file" silently returns a Rule 5.1
certification, a cover letter or a verification page — and reports success.

Conflating the two overstates coverage by 15-20 points. That is not a rounding error: it is a
fabricated denominator under every downstream rate, and shipping it is more harmful than
returning nothing, because nobody downstream can see it happened.

## The Iron Law of Absence

**Never record a document as unavailable because YOUR SELECTION RULE failed. Enumerate the docket
entries and look for a later substantive version before concluding it is not public.**

This is the mirror of the law above. That one catches substitutes passed off as complaints; this
one catches real complaints recorded as absent — and it is the more expensive failure, because a
substitute is visible in the data while an absence looks like a fact about the world.

**Delaware Chancery files the complaint confidentially, then files a redacted PUBLIC VERSION days
later as a SEPARATE docket entry** (Ct. Ch. R. 5.1). Every vendor rule that stops at the first
complaint-tagged entry sees no document and reports failure. The public version sits **typically
around entry 10-15, measured as deep as entry 91**, on dockets running to 277 entries.

Measured 2026-08-31/09-01 on two independent Delaware populations:

| population | "unavailable" cases | had a public version | rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DGCL 220 complaints | 253 | 229 | **90.5%** |
| fiduciary-duty follow-on suits | 80 | 73 | **91.2%** |

Recovering them moved coverage **82.2% -> 95.3%** and added **195 confirmed cases** to a study
population. The pre-recovery write-up asserted "~18% of complaints are not publicly retrievable —
a finding about practice, not a collection defect." That sentence was wrong in both halves.

**The correct statement is "~18% are filed confidentially, and ~90% of those are publicly
available as a redacted version elsewhere on the same docket." Genuine unavailability is ~4%.**

### Two defects that bite while recovering them

- **Match the public version to a COMPLAINT, not to any document mentioning one.** `Public Version
  of Answer to Verified Complaint` and `Motion to Extend Deadline to File Public Version of the
  Verified Complaint` both contain "public version" and "complaint". Requiring only those two terms
  returned the wrong document on **10.6% (23/218) and 10.0% (7/73)** of cases across two
  populations — a stable rate, so expect it. Exclude `answer|affirmative defense|motion|letter|
  certificat|opposition|brief|reply|response|stipulation|notice|transcript|order`.
- **A resume guard keyed on filename alone silently preserves a known-bad file.** After fixing the
  regex, the re-fetch skipped every corrected case as `already_present`, because the wrong document
  from the first pass sat on disk under the same name. Quarantine before re-fetching.

**Redaction does not degrade extraction.** Measured on the recovered set: `misconduct_category`,
`plaintiff_law_firm` and `requester_type` all came back at **0% missing**, identical to the
unredacted baseline. Captions, parties, statutory citations, prayer for relief and signature
blocks survive; body allegations may be blacked out. Carry a `source` flag and check the
`not_stated` rate before using them for content coding.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Vendor facts

- **Lex Machina lists the complaint with an empty `files[]` on ~18.7% of cases** (298/1,597) —
  which means it was filed confidentially, NOT that it is unavailable; see the Iron Law of
  Absence above. The
  document id and title are present; only the file is withheld. That is `file_withheld`, a
  recoverable fact worth recording — not "not found", and not a reason to substitute another
  document.
- **Docket Alarm returns HTTP 500 with a ~40 KB HTML body when it does not hold the file.** It is
  reproducible on a fresh cookie and never recovers, so retrying it is pure waste; at a ~15%
  failure rate the retry backoff was the dominant cost of a run until it was removed.
- **Some Docket Alarm documents never respond at all.** One hanging request plus a 300 s timeout
  plus an ordered `ThreadPoolExecutor.map` is indistinguishable from a deadlocked process. Use a
  45-90 s timeout.
- **Bloomberg's `accessToken` is HttpOnly with an ~8 minute TTL**, refreshed by the page's own SPA
  on a timer — not by your requests. The tab must stay open; a cookie snapshot into any external
  store authenticates for minutes, not hours.
- **Bloomberg's CSV export silently truncates at 1,000 rows** — no warning in the file or the UI.
  Always cross-check an export against the API's own `remote_count` and date-slice below the cap.
- **Docket Alarm's search endpoint is bot-protected: HTTP 400 outside the browser**, 200 via
  same-origin `fetch()` in a logged-in tab. Per-docket pages are fine outside. Do not fight it.
- **~18% of Delaware Chancery §220 complaints are unavailable from all three vendors**, and they
  fail on the *same* cases — adding two vendors to the best single one bought 17 cases out of
  1,597. If coverage stalls near 82%, that is the record, not your pipeline.

## Finding decisions in a docket

- **The docket line names the DOCUMENT, not the holding.** Entries read `Memorandum Opinion`; the
  grant/deny is inside the PDF. Only ~15/152 opinion entries mention an outcome word at all.
- **Chancery disposes of cases through a Magistrate's Final Report**, then an order implementing
  it: `Granted ([Proposed] Order Implementing the Court's Post-Trial Bench Ruling)`. Searching only
  for `Memorandum Opinion` / `Letter Decision` **missed 34% of cases with a decision** (169 found
  vs 257 that exist). Always include: `final report`, `master's report`, `post-trial ruling`,
  `bench ruling`, `opinion and order`, `final order and judgment`.
- **Never search for opinions only within cases you already classified as having one.** That is
  circular and it hides exactly the misclassifications you are trying to find. Scan the whole
  population.

## Red Flags — STOP If You Catch Yourself:

| About to | Why wrong | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| About to record a complaint as unavailable because the first entry has no file | The Rule 5.1 public version sits further down the docket ~90% of the time | Enumerate the entries and search for a later substantive version |
| Matching a public version on "public version" + "complaint" | Also matches answers, motions and briefs ABOUT the complaint — 10% wrong-document rate on two populations | Exclude answer/motion/brief/letter/certificate terms |
| Re-fetching after a selection fix without clearing the old files | A filename-keyed resume guard reports `already_present` and keeps the known-bad document | Quarantine, then re-fetch |
| Report "session expired" because the cookie read came back empty | An empty cookie *name* (`['']`) is a parsing failure, not an absent session. Picking the first CDP page target returns nothing when that tab is `blob:`/`chrome://` — this cost hours and triggered a needless credential hunt | Use `scripts/lm_cookie.py`, which selects a page on the requested host; verify by fetching one document |
| Pin the session cookie into a `Cookie:` header | It goes stale mid-run when the vendor rotates it, and the resulting 401s look exactly like rate limiting | Put cookies in the `requests` cookie jar; re-read from the browser on a 401 |
| Retry a Docket Alarm HTTP 500 | Reproducible "document not held"; the backoff dominates the run | Record it and move on |
| Take `documents[0]` when no title matches the entry text | That is how a sealing motion becomes a "complaint" | Mark `is_substitute`, never `ok` |
| Run `pdftotext`/`pdfinfo` inside the download loop | A long timeout on one malformed PDF stalls a worker and looks like a hang | Compute page/text metrics in a post-pass |
| `kill $!` after `setsid`, or `pkill -f` a pattern matching your own shell | Kills the wrong PID and leaves crawlers running — three concurrent copies hit one vendor this way | `ps -eo pid,cmd \| awk '/[d]a_grab/'` then kill the real pid |
| Trust a vendor's case-type tag as ground truth | Tags put a judicial letter, a §225 petition and a notary page in a books-and-records population | Screen from the document text |
| Conclude coverage is complete without checking the whole population | Every widening of the net raised the count: 6.5% → 10.7% → 16.1% written decisions | Scan all cases, all document-type spellings |
