# Bluebook Citation (22nd edition; 21st still reachable)

**What this skill carries.** The names and headings are the index; for a subject none of
them carries, `grep -il <term> ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/*.md`.

!`skill-toc ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`

Citation formatting for law reviews and legal scholarship per *The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation* (21st ed. 2020).

**Announce:** "I’m using the bluebook skill for citation formatting."

## When to Use

Invoke this skill for:
- Formatting case citations (federal, state, foreign)
- Statutory and regulatory citations
- Secondary sources (books, articles, treatises)
- Short form citations (id., supra, hereinafter)
- Introductory signals and parentheticals
- Citation sentences vs. citation clauses

**For legal writing style**: Use `/writing-legal` skill (Volokh)
**For general writing**: Use `/writing` skill (Strunk & White)

**To RENDER these rules in a Typst manuscript**: this skill states the rules; it does
not implement them. `docx-typst` carries the implementation — `assets/bluebook.typ` is a
`#show cite:` rule supplying the three things typst's built-in bibliography cannot
(`supra note N`, small-caps reporters, `shortjournal` → `container-title-short`), because
hayagriva is statically linked into the typst binary and renders none of them. Reach for
it whenever a Typst document needs the short forms in `references/short-forms.md` to
renumber themselves rather than be typed by hand.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## IRON LAW #1: NO CITATION WITHOUT VERIFICATION

**If you haven’t verified EVERY element of a citation, DO NOT write it.**

Before writing ANY citation:
1. Verify case name spelling and procedural posture
2. Verify reporter volume and page numbers
3. Verify court and year
4. Verify pinpoint page exists

**Guessing reporter volumes or page numbers is NOT HELPFUL — the user publishes with wrong citations that fail verification. Period.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## IRON LAW #2: NO SHORT FORMS WITHOUT FULL CITATION FIRST

**Id., supra, and hereinafter REQUIRE a preceding full citation.**

Before using ANY short form:
1. Locate the full citation in the document
2. Verify no intervening citations (for id.)
3. Verify the supra reference is unambiguous

**Using id. after intervening citations creates ambiguity. Delete and cite in full.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## IRON LAW #3: FOOTNOTE VS. TEXT CITATION FORMAT

**Law review citations use footnote format (Rule 1). Court documents use text format (Bluepages).**

```
FOOTNOTE (law reviews):    Smith v. Jones, 500 U.S. 1, 5 (1991).
TEXT (court documents):    Smith v. Jones, 500 U.S. 1, 5 (1991)

FOOTNOTE (statutes):       18 U.S.C. § 1001 (2018).
TEXT (statutes):           18 U.S.C. § 1001 (2018)
```

**If writing for a law review and using text format conventions, DELETE and reformat.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Gate Function

Before writing ANY citation:

```
1. IDENTIFY → What type of source? (case, statute, article, book)
2. LOCATE   → Find the correct rule in Bluebook
3. VERIFY   → Confirm ALL elements (volume, page, court, year)
4. FORMAT   → Apply correct typeface and punctuation
5. CHECK    → Does this match examples in the rule?
6. WRITE    → Only after steps 1-5
```

**Skipping any step produces unreliable citations.**

## Citation Facts

- An intervening citation breaks *id.* — *id.* after an intervening cite is ambiguous and must become a full short form. *Supra* only works when the full citation it points to actually exists earlier in the document.
- Signals are checked against Rule 1.2 examples, not intuition — a wrong signal misleads the reader about how the source supports the proposition.
- Parentheticals explain the source's relevance; pinpoints prove the specific claim. A cite deferred ("I'll add the pinpoint later") ships without one.
- Typeface (Rule 2) is mandatory, not stylistic. Abbreviations come from tables T6, T10, T12 — "common" or "obvious" abbreviations that don't match the tables fail cite-check.
- "Pretty sure" about a reporter volume or page number means unverified — a guessed element presented as a citation is an unverified claim, and exact pinpoints are required.

| Source Type | Law Review Format |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Case names | Italics: *Brown v. Board* |
| Book titles | Small caps: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW |
| Article titles | Italics: *On the Expressive Function* |
| Journal names | Small caps: U. PA. L. REV. |
| Periodical names (non-consecutively paginated) | Italics: *N.Y. Times* |

5. *See also*
6. *Cf.*
7. *Compare*
8. *Contra*

## Progressive Disclosure

For detailed rules, consult:

### Reference Files

- **`references/cases.md`** - Complete case citation rules (R. 10)
- **`references/statutes.md`** - Statutory and regulatory citations (R. 12-14)
- **`references/secondary-sources.md`** - Books, articles, treatises (R. 15-17)
- **`references/short-forms.md`** - Id., supra, hereinafter rules (R. 4)
- **`references/quotations.md`** - Block quotes, alterations, ellipses (R. 5)
- **`references/signals-parentheticals.md`** - Signals, parentheticals, order (R. 1)
- **`references/audit-patterns.md`** - Citation audit patterns and validation
- **`references/abbreviations.md`** - Bluebook abbreviation tables
- **`references/editions-21-to-22.md`** - What changed in the 22nd edition, from the publisher's preface plus rule-by-rule checks

**All eight reference files are now checked against the rule text.**

| file | rules | status |
|---|---|---|
| `quotations.md` | 5 | verified vs 21e scan AND 22e; 6 errors corrected |
| `signals-parentheticals.md` | 1 | rebuilt from 22e; carries the new `contrast` signal |
| `short-forms.md` | 4 | rebuilt from 22e |
| `cases.md` | 10 | rebuilt from 22e |
| `statutes.md` | 12 (13-14 NOT in corpus) | rebuilt from 22e; 13-14 flagged in place |
| `secondary-sources.md` | 15, 16, 17 | rebuilt from 22e |
| `abbreviations.md` | 10.2.2, 15.1(e), 16.1, T6 | rebuilt from 22e; T6 reproduced from the capture, table gaps flagged in place |
| `audit-patterns.md` | cross-cutting (1, 4, 10, 12, 15-18, T6) | rebuilt from 22e; every check names its rule, untraceable checks marked in place |

All six were then **adversarially re-verified** by separate agents against the same corpus, with
instructions to find errors rather than agree: `signals-parentheticals.md` and `short-forms.md`
came back with **zero contradictions** (every imperative traced to a governing sentence);
`cases.md`, `statutes.md` and `secondary-sources.md` each had defects, all now corrected. Reports:
`scratch/bb22/verify/`.

All eight were checked against subsection pages extracted verbatim from the official Bluebook
Online 22nd edition; page cites in them are **22e** pages. Claims the corpus did not cover are
marked UNVERIFIED in place rather than left looking checked. Per-file reports:
`scratch/bb22/reports/`. Rule 5 verdicts: `scratch/bluebook-verify/REPORT.md`.

**What is still unchecked, and why.** "Rebuilt from 22e" means every claim traces to the extracted
corpus or is marked in place — it does not mean the whole rule surface was available. These gaps
are real and are flagged inside the files rather than papered over:

| gap | state of the capture | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Table T10** (geographical terms) | **captured in full** — T10.1 (22e pp. 340-42), T10.2 and T10.3 as separate subtable pages | its values may be stated |
| **Table T13** (institutional names in periodical titles, 22e pp. 346-48) | **captured in full** — the earlier empty capture used a wrong slug (`t13-institutional-names-...` rather than `t13-periodicals`) | its values may be stated |
| Tables T1, T7, T11, T12 and the rest | never fetched | cross-references to them are reported; their contents are not |
| Rules 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 | never fetched | checks resting on them are marked, not asserted. Rules 3, 5, 20, 21 and 23 have since been extracted |

Nothing from these gaps has been filled from training knowledge. A claim depending on one is
either absent or carries a marker within a line of itself.

### Looking a rule up in the actual book

**Best source: the official Bluebook Online, 22nd edition.** UVA Law provides institutional
access and the browser on CDP 9222 is already signed in. This is live publisher text — no OCR, no
auth expiry, no retrieval tricks — and it is the source of record.

```
https://www.legalbluebook.com/bluebook/v22/rules/<n>-<slug>
https://www.legalbluebook.com/bluebook/v22/rules/<n>-<slug>/<n>-<m>-<slug>

e.g. /bluebook/v22/rules/5-quotations/5-2-alterations-and-quotations-within-quotations
```

Swap `v22` for `v21` to read the 21st edition; the site's own dropdown does the same. Drive it
with the `browser-automation` skill (Linux → `mcp__chrome-devtools__*` on 9222). If that MCP
server is not connected this session, raw CDP over `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/list` works — and
**open a new tab rather than navigating the user's**.

**EDITION MATTERS, IN TWO WAYS.** The 22nd is now live and is the default.

**`references/editions-21-to-22.md` is the guide** — the publisher's preface (which names changes
in rules 1.2, 10.8.3, 12.4(f), 14.4, 15.1(d), 15.8, 18, 20.2.4, new 22 and 23, and tables T1.3,
T1.5, T2, T6, T10) plus the rule-by-rule differences verified here. Read it before trusting
anything in this skill against a 22e manuscript. Three things that bite immediately:

- **Rules 22 and 23 are NEW**; the 21st stops at 21. Rules 1-21 keep their numbers.
- **Pagination moved** — Rule 5 is 22e pp. 87-91 against 21e-scan pp. 103-108. A bare page cite is
  ambiguous; name the edition.
- **The preface's list is partial.** Rule 5.1(a)(i) gained "single spaced" in the 22nd and the
  preface never mentions it. Absence from the preface is not evidence a rule is unchanged.

### Pinpoint — the 21st edition, full scan



**Pinpoint holds the full 21st edition — use it.** A complete 394-page scan is in the `Bluebook`
collection (`b7425c3f3368f9c9`), OCR'd by Google, searchable to the page. This is the authoritative
lookup for any rule in this skill, and it is what `references/quotations.md` was finally verified
against.

```bash
pinpoint search Bluebook "<terms>" --pages --order density --limit 60
pinpoint generate ask Bluebook "<question>"       # locates fast; do NOT quote its paraphrase
```

Four things learned the hard way, all of which cost a pass:

- **`--order density`, not the default.** Document order means a bounded run stops early — Rule 5
  sits at scan pp. 103-108 and a default-ordered run never reached past p. 71.
- **It OR-matches; a quoted phrase returns zero.** Cast wide and filter locally with `awk`.
- **`--no-dedupe` when a page you know exists will not come back.** Rule 1.5(b) at p. 86 returned
  nothing across four term sets at limits up to 120; `--no-dedupe --limit 200` returned it in full.
- **Quote from `--pages`, never from `generate ask`.** It locates well and paraphrases
  confidently — it produced a fluent synthesis of a capitalization test that no line in the book
  supports.

Auth expires within the hour (`API error 7 (PermissionDenied)`); `pinpoint auth` re-lifts the
session from the CDP browser. Re-auth and retry — do not read an auth failure as "the rule is not
in the book."

### NotebookLM — narrow, and mostly superseded

The notebook (`f70a9976-b443-43d5-b5fd-43ff86b2b700`) holds a **53-page excerpt**, not the book.
Verified 2026-08-23: the only full rule text is **Rule 1 and 1.1-1.4** (pp. 51, 53) plus the Quick
Reference tables. Everything else is cover scans and cropped strips of the printed book's **thumb
tabs** — so "rule 10", "rule 12" appear as tab labels with nothing behind them, and a model asked
what the PDF contains will read those tabs and name rules it cannot quote. It did exactly that
before retracting under stricter questioning. It cannot answer on Rule 5 at all.

**Refuse its web-research offer.** On a rule it does not hold it replies "Would you like me to
perform some web research?" — observed three times. Accepting turns a web search into something
formatted as a source-grounded answer, which is how an unverified reference file gets written by
an author who believes they consulted the book.

Prefer Pinpoint above. Reach for the notebook only for Rule 1 or the Quick Reference tables:

**When to query the notebook:**
- Rule wording is ambiguous in reference files
- Formatting international or specialized materials
- Checking obscure abbreviations not in quick reference
- Resolving conflicts between rules
- Understanding historical changes from previous editions

### When to Load References

Load the specific reference when:
- Formatting an unfamiliar source type
- Encountering edge cases (unpublished cases, foreign sources)
- Checking state-specific reporter requirements
- Working with complex statutory schemes
- Formatting international materials

## Integration

Use with `/writing-legal` for complete legal scholarship workflow:
1. `/bluebook` formats citations correctly
2. `/writing-legal` ensures argument structure and evidence handling
3. `/ai-anti-patterns` catches AI writing indicators before submission

## Delete & Restart Pattern

**When to delete and restart:**

1. **Citation uses guessed page numbers** → Delete, verify source, cite with real numbers
2. **Id. follows intervening citation** → Delete id., use full short form
3. **Wrong signal used** → Delete, reread Rule 1.2, apply correct signal
4. **Typeface incorrect** → Delete, apply Rule 2 typeface
5. **Abbreviation doesn’t match Bluebook tables** → Delete, use table abbreviation

**How to restart:**

```
Old: See Smith v. Jones, 500 U.S. at 15. Id. at 20. [intervening cite] Id. at 25.
New: See Smith v. Jones, 500 U.S. at 15. Id. at 20. [intervening cite] Smith, 500 U.S. at 25.
```

The third cite cannot use id. after an intervening citation.
