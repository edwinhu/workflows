 *
 * 2 and 3 are separate because a caller must be able to tell "you invoked me wrong" from "I could

/**
 * A DECLARED suppression of one rule, scoped to a file or to a region of one.
 *
 * Grammar — the marker must be the WHOLE trimmed line, optionally behind a `//`, `#` or `*`
 * comment lead-in so it is expressible in TypeScript and in Markdown alike:
 *
 *     <!-- wc-probe: ignore-paths -->            file-scoped, rule `paths`
 *     <!-- wc-probe: ignore-returns:start -->    opens a region for rule `returns`
 *     <!-- wc-probe: ignore-returns:end -->      closes it (an unclosed region runs to EOF)
 *     <!-- wc-probe: ignore-all -->              every rule, file-scoped
 *
 * The rule name is matched loosely on purpose — letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `-` — and then checked
 * against `KNOWN_EXEMPTION_RULES` by P9. A name outside that list is a FINDING, never a silent
 * no-op: see the note on `EXEMPT_LINE_RE` for why parsing a wrong name matters more than refusing it.
 *
 * Whole-line matching is load-bearing. Substring matching made this very file exempt from its own
 * P2 the moment it defined the marker string, which is the failure mode the mechanism exists to
 * prevent: a suppression nobody declared. Every exemption applied is returned in `ProbeResult` and
 * printed by the CLI in BOTH modes — a suppressed check that nobody can see is indistinguishable
 * from a check that passed.
 *
 * The legitimate case is a file that QUOTES broken input as evidence about the input itself. This
 * skill's own are counted in EXEMPTION ENTRIES — `notesFor` emits one `SUPPRESSED` note per entry,
 * whole-file or region-scoped alike, so two region markers for one rule in one file print twice.
 * Only whole-file entries are declared here, so entries, rule×file pairs and notes coincide at FOUR
 * across THREE files, all four reported on every run (SKILL.md's "Declared exemptions" table lists
 * the same four; a mismatch between the two is the undeclared-suppression failure, not a doc nit):
 *
 *   references/hook-reach.md   `paths`             — records that `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` does not
 *                                                    substitute inside `hooks:` frontmatter, and the
 *                                                    proof IS the unsubstituted command string.
 *   scripts/wc-probe.test.ts   `paths`, `returns`  — its fixtures are deliberately broken paths and
 *                                                    fake documented return shapes.  (2 pairs)
 *   scripts/parity-check.sh    `paths`             — its fixture writes a deliberately broken
 *                                                    `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` reference so the two
 *                                                    surfaces have something to disagree about.
