# check.sh — the ONE mechanical entry point for a workflow skill. Its exit code IS the mechanical
# verdict: 0 only when every leg passed. A workflow declares this command and nothing else, because
# a list of N independent commands loses one silently and nothing reports a check it never knew
# about.
#
# Usage: check.sh --target <skill dir> [--agent <agent .md outside the skill dir>]
#
# Legs (all four run; none short-circuits, so one line is printed per leg every time):
#   wc-probe     the probe over --target (and --agent, which lives outside it)
#   parity       gate-vs-write-hook agreement — takes no target
#   node-check   `node --check` over <target>/*.js; PASSES when the target ships none
#   probe-tests  `bun test <target>/scripts/*.test.ts` — TARGET-relative, so pointing this at a
#                generated skill runs THAT skill's suite; a scripts/ dir with no test file FAILS
#
# stdout carries only the leg lines (the verdict); each leg's own output goes to stderr, so
# counting `^leg ` on stdout counts legs and nothing else.
#
# Exit 0 = every leg passed. 1 = some leg failed. 2 = refusal (bad usage, missing target).
set -uo pipefail  # deliberately not -e: every leg must run so every leg reports.
