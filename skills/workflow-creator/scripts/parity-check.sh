#
# wc-probe.ts (gate time) and validate-skill-write.ts (write time) share their predicates but not
# their dispatch, and that is exactly where they came apart before: sharing the predicates and not
# the dispatch left the bug one level up. This asserts they return the SAME rule set for one agent
# .md carrying one known defect.

# It lived as a mechanicalChecks `cmd` string for a while — a single line carrying four levels of
# shell/JSON escaping, quoted into a plan, retyped by whoever dispatched the run. That is the shape
# the skill's own doctrine warns about: a command that exists only as a string in a document is
# executed by nothing and verified by no one, and this one eventually failed to survive being passed
# through a JSON argument at all. A file can be run, tested, diffed and committed. A string cannot.
#
# Writes only under `mktemp -d`, and removes it. Safe on a readOnly run.
#
# Exit 0 = the two surfaces agree. Exit 1 = they disagree (the output shows both sides).
#
# DECLARED EXEMPTION: the fixture below writes a deliberately broken ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} reference
# so both surfaces have something to disagree about. It is data, not a path this script uses.
