/**
 * The documentation contract for --loops, made decidable.
 *
 * Two rules, both computed rather than judged — an open-ended prose review of a doc does not
 * terminate, so what is asserted here is only what a grep can settle:
 *
 *   1. Every long flag work-dispatch.sh's argument parser ACCEPTS is named in its own usage header.
 *      This is the rule that catches the real drift: a flag added to the `case` and never written
 *      down is invisible to every future reader, including the model reading the header to learn
 *      the interface.
 *   2. SKILL.md documents the flag and the exit codes the driver returns — and grows by less than
 *      25 lines doing it, because SKILL.md is re-read into context on EVERY craft invocation, so a
 *      line there is a recurring token cost, not a one-time one.
 *
 * Run: bun test /home/eh/projects/workflows/skills/work/scripts/work-loops-docs.test.ts
