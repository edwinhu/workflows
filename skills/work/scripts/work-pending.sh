#
# Armed  = the newest plan carries a `<!-- craft:dispatch … -->` block. Writing that block is
#          what arms the run, and the plan is the only file plan mode may write — which is also
#          the only thing that survives the context clear on plan approval.
# Undispatched = no .craft/*/args.json records this plan's CURRENT spec hash, and that hash is
#          not listed in .craft/abandoned. The hash is over the dispatch block's canonical JSON,
#          so editing the prose around it does not read as an un-dispatched amendment.
#
# Prints "<planPath>\t<runId>" and exits 0 when a dispatch is owed; silent exit 1 otherwise.
# Called per Edit/Write by main-thread-guard.sh, so the negative path must stay cheap: the
# directory test below fires before anything reads or hashes a file.
