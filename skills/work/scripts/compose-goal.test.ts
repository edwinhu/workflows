/**
 * compose-goal.sh — the /goal line craft self-sends, built so every clause is DECIDABLE.
 *
 * Two defects it fixes, both measured on a live episode that could not close its own goal:
 *
 *  1. `or stop after N turns` was prose and nothing counted turns. /goal installs a Stop hook judged
 *     by a model reading the transcript; no num_turns / turn_count exists anywhere. The judge found
 *     the clause satisfied on four consecutive evaluations and reasoned out of each, ending at the
 *     position that stopping DELIBERATELY disqualifies the escape while losing control would qualify
 *     — a condition that releases on runaway but not on a clean finish. The escape now names a
 *     ROUND COUNTER FILE, so the check is a `cat` whose output lands in the transcript as evidence.
 *
 *  2. `workflow.js has returned PASS ... AT ITS CURRENT HASH` was unsatisfiable after success — the
 *     hash clause, not the PASS clause, was the defect: the FAIL loop is expected to amend and
 *     re-hash the plan, so a pinned digest self-invalidates. The reading that PASS itself is
 *     unreachable (red-not-red on a completed plan) was already stale when it was written:
 *     `redDisposition` shipped 2026-08-17 and is what a completed task declares instead of a red
 *     gate. The goal names PASS by PATH, and the round cap stops a run that cannot get there.
 *
 * Run: bun test ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/work/scripts/compose-goal.test.ts
