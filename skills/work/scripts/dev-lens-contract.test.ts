/**
 * dev-lens-contract.test.ts — the dev template's lens set and its per-task authority.
 *
 *   bun test ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/work/scripts/dev-lens-contract.test.ts
 *
 * The tests LENS is retired: four mechanical shapes it used to catch late are now computed before
 * dispatch, and the eleven Warning Signs it cannot mechanise are better spent shaping tests as they
 * are written than judging them after they exist. So the vendored writing-good-tests.md moves into
 * the per-task refs and authorityExtra, where every implementer reads it before writing a test.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE READS `git show HEAD:` — deliberately. An earlier draft took its baseline from HEAD
 * and asserted the baseline still shipped a tests lens; that holds only while the change is
 * uncommitted, so the suite would have gone permanently red on the first commit and taken the whole
 * craft mechanical check (`bun test .../skills/work/scripts/`) with it. A suite whose verdict
 * depends on whether the tree has been committed is not a contract.
 *
 * Non-vacuity is proved instead by MUTATION: the same parser is run over a synthetic template that
 * still carries a tests lens, and must report it. A parser that silently found nothing would fail
 * that test, so "no tests lens remains" cannot pass by accident.
 *
 * skills/dev/SKILL.md is context-loaded on EVERY dev invocation, so every line is a recurring token
 * cost paid by every agent. The ceiling below is absolute rather than HEAD-relative for the same
 * reason: a budget measured against a moving baseline is not a budget.
