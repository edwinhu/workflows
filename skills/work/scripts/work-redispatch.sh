# The FAIL loop is: fix, amend the plan, re-hash, re-dispatch. Doing that by hand is where a
# specHash gets typed from a stale copy, and where an args file drifts from the plan it names.
# The hash is over the plan's CANONICAL craft:dispatch spec (work-dispatch.sh --spec-hash), so a
# prose-only amendment between rounds moves nothing.
#
# Re-hashing is not enough on its own, so this also RE-SYNCS the plan's `craft:dispatch` block into
# the args: `redCommand` is executed from args.json and `work` is what the implementer is handed, so
# a plan amendment that never reached the args is an amendment that never ran. Run-local keys
# (onlyTasks, priorResults, priorFindings, freezeFindingSet, maxAgents, maxRounds) are not in the
# plan and are preserved.

# SELECTIVE RE-RUN, with --dispatch and derived here rather than remembered: `onlyTasks` is the
# previous verdict's `tasksThatFlagged` CLOSED UNDER TRANSITIVE DEPENDENTS, and `priorResults` (with
# `red`, so a carried task keeps its adjudication) carries everything else. The closure is the
# soundness condition: a carried "verified" for a task downstream of a re-run one was earned against
# code that no longer exists. A previous result that is absent, unreadable, or whose
# `tasksThatFlagged` cannot be parsed falls back to a FULL re-run and says so — a scope built from a
# verdict nobody could read is the vacuous pass craft exists to prevent. Lenses and mechanical checks
# judge the whole deliverable and are never narrowed.
#
# With --dispatch, the run directory is args.json's own directory; result.json there is rotated to
# result-<n>.json first so a stale verdict can never be read as this run's.
#
# FROZEN FINDING SET + ROUND CAP, both with --dispatch. On the advance to round 2 the previous
# verdict's surviving blocking findings are carried into `priorFindings` and `freezeFindingSet` is
# set, ONCE: from there the loop asks whether that carried set is closed (each entry is adversarially
# refuted every round) rather than whether this round's lenses raised anything. Fresh blocking lens
# findings are reported as `residue` and do not gate. `maxRounds` (default 6) is a hard stop: the
# dispatch that would exceed it is refused with exit 4, prints what is still open as a paste-ready
# priorFindings block for a fresh run, and hands the run to human review.
#
# TIER 1 GATE, mirroring work-dispatch.sh: with --dispatch, plan-lint.ts runs on the FINAL args —
# after the plan block is re-synced and the counters advanced — and a major/critical exits 3. It
# fails CLOSED. The mutations are STAGED until it passes: a refusal spends no round, rotates no
# result and does not touch args.json, so the run is left exactly as it was.
