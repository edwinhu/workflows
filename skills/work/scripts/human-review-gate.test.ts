/**
 * The review gate's verdict rule — approval must be expressible in words.
 *
 * The gate matched \bREJECT\b in a comment and had no APPROVE counterpart, while ANY comment forced
 * the verdict `findings`. So a reviewer could reject with one word but could not approve with any
 * number of them: measured on a live episode, a human wrote "looks good to me, ship" and then "all
 * good", and both registered as outstanding work, leaving the run unable to close.
 *
 * These drive `review-verdict.py` — the module the gate itself imports, not a copy of its logic. A
 * test over a re-implementation proves the re-implementation works.
 *
 * Run: bun test ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/work/scripts/human-review-gate.test.ts
