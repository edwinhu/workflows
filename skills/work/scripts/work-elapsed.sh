# Rounds are not time. Measured 2026-08-19 (mail-bridge): rounds took 3h+ each, so a `rounds >= 4`
# escape sat twelve hours out while nobody was awake to close the human half of the goal. The run
# was working the whole time and still could not stop.
#
# The ceiling is DENOMINATED IN MINUTES and defaults to 10. It bounds WAITING, not working: a
# session with work left does that work whatever this prints, because the Stop hook only asks
# whether stopping is permitted, never whether it is required. An hours-scale default bought
# nothing but hours of a session sitting on a human who had already walked away.
#
# The clock lives HERE, not in the goal text: a Stop-hook judge reading a transcript cannot
# subtract timestamps reliably, but it can read one printed line that already says CEILING REACHED.
