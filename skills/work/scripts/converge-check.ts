/**
 * converge-check.ts — is this craft run converging, or drawing from a constant-rate generator?
 *
 *   bun converge-check.ts <run-dir> [--json]
 *
 * exit 0  CONVERGING
 * exit 1  NOT CONVERGING — every reason is named
 * exit 2  too short to judge, or the run dir cannot be read
 *
 * ADVISORY. Nothing here gates a dispatch; the round cap in work-redispatch.sh is what stops a run.
 * This says WHY it had to be stopped.
 *
 * Every input is a file craft already writes — `result-round<N>.json`, `result.json`, `args.json`,
 * the archived `plan-*.md`. No LLM, no new state.
 *
 * THE VERDICT IS THE SURVIVING-BLOCKING SEQUENCE. A fix loop converges when the blocking set it is
 * closing SHRINKS; a sequence that rises, or that ends where it started, is a loop whose exit is a
 * coin flip rather than depletion. Generation slope, repeat rate and the deliverable/gate split are
 * measured and printed because they say which failure this is — they are not extra verdicts.
 * Accretion is its own reason: it needs no history, and in the corpus it is what the two runs that
 * never converged had and no other run did.
 *
 * A REPEATED FAILURE is its own reason too, and the earliest one available: when round N fails in
 * exactly the places round N-1 failed, two independent implementers hit one wall, which is evidence
 * about the BRIEF rather than about either of them.
