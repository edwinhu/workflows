# exit 0  shape is a craft gate return, every claimed mechanical exit code was re-observed, overallPass true

#
# THIS EXIT CODE IS THE VERDICT. A model is in the return path (the delegated agent transcribes the
# workflow's object into the file), so a caller reading overallPass out of the file is trusting that
# model; the adjudication below is what makes the code trustworthy where the field is not.
#
# Adjudication: `args.json` beside the result names each mechanical check's cmd, and EVERY declared
# check is re-run here, in a shell, from the run's projectDir. Not only the claimed passes: this file
# is a transcription of the gate object, so a transcription pairing a claimed-failed check with
# overallPass true would otherwise be waved through. Re-running all of them is affordable because a
# workflow exposes one entry point per component. The one exception is a check claiming exitCode -1,
# the sentinel for a probe that never reported: no claim exists to contradict, so it FAILS not refuses.
