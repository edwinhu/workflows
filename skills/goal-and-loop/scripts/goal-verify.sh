# "Goal set:", and Claude Code's `/goal active` chrome renders only in the working spinner, so an
# idle pane shows nothing whether or not a goal is set.

# The transcript record is unforgeable by prose because it is matched at the START of a record's

# that merely mentions the phrase is a different record whose content does not begin with it.
