# Debugging Executed Notebooks

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

This skill covers inspecting executed `.ipynb` files to debug runtime errors, regardless of how the notebook was created (marimo, jupytext, or plain Jupyter).

**If debugging within a /ds workflow**, first read `.planning/LEARNINGS.md` for pipeline context and `.planning/PLAN.md` for task expectations.

## Verification Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO 'NOTEBOOK WORKS' CLAIM WITHOUT TRACEBACK CHECK

Before claiming ANY notebook executed successfully, you MUST:
1. **EXECUTE** the notebook to ipynb with outputs
2. **CHECK** for tracebacks (Quick Failure Check section)
3. **READ** the ipynb file with Read tool if errors found
4. **VERIFY** all cells have execution_count (not null)
5. **INSPECT** outputs for warnings/unexpected behavior
6. **CLAIM** success only after all verification passes

This is not negotiable. Skipping traceback checks is NOT HELPFUL — the user opens a notebook that throws errors on first run.

### Notebook Execution Facts

- Exit code 0 from the executor does not mean the cells succeeded — tracebacks live inside cell outputs. Claiming "notebook works" from the exit code alone is an unverified claim presented as fact.
- Running the `.py` source file directly loses cell-level outputs and error attribution. Execute to ipynb first, then inspect.
- The grep quick check reads only `outputs[].text` — it misses stderr and structured `error` outputs. Use BOTH the quick check AND the Read tool.
- Cells downstream of a failure are skipped with `execution_count: null` — a middle-cell failure is invisible unless you verify every cell executed.
- The cell that raises is often not the root cause — bad data originates upstream (observed: root cause 5 cells above the error cell). Tracing only the error cell misses it.

### Red Flags — STOP If About To:

- Claim success without checking the exported ipynb outputs → STOP. Execute to ipynb and inspect.
- Reuse a previous run's outputs as evidence → STOP. Fresh execution EVERY time.
- Claim correctness from reading the source code → STOP. Code inspection ≠ runtime verification.
- Apply a fix without reproducing the error first → STOP. An unreproduced fix is an unverifiable fix.

### Verification Checklist

Before claiming "notebook works":

**Execution:**
- [ ] Execute notebook to ipynb format
- [ ] Use `--include-outputs` flag (for marimo)
- [ ] Verify output file created successfully
- [ ] Verify output file is non-empty

**Traceback Check:**
- [ ] Run quick failure check: `jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' | grep "Traceback"`
- [ ] Check error count: `jq '[.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error")] | length'`
- [ ] Use Read tool to inspect full context if errors found

**Cell Execution:**
- [ ] Verify all cells have execution_count (no null values)
- [ ] Check execution order is sequential (no out-of-order cells)
- [ ] Verify no cells skipped due to prior failures

**Output Inspection:**
- [ ] Verify critical outputs (not just absence of errors)
- [ ] Check expected results present (dataframes, plots, metrics)
- [ ] Verify no warnings that indicate problems
- [ ] Check no unexpected NaN/None/empty results

**Claim success only after:**
- [ ] All checks pass: declare "notebook executed successfully"

### Gate Function: Notebook Verification

Apply this verification sequence for every notebook debugging task:

```
1. EXECUTE → Run to ipynb with outputs
2. CHECK   → Quick traceback/error count check
3. READ    → Full inspection with Read tool if errors
4. VERIFY  → All cells executed, outputs as expected
5. CLAIM   → "Notebook works" only after all gates passed
```

**Never skip any gate.** Each gate catches different failure modes.

## Why Execute to ipynb?

Converting and executing notebooks to ipynb captures:
- Cell outputs and return values
- Tracebacks with full context
- Execution order and cell IDs

This makes debugging much easier than reading raw `.py` source.

## Execution Commands

```bash
# Export marimo notebook to ipynb with outputs
marimo export ipynb notebook.py -o __marimo__/notebook.ipynb --include-outputs

# Convert jupytext to ipynb and execute with outputs
jupytext --to notebook --output - script.py | papermill - output.ipynb

# Execute existing ipynb notebook to capture outputs
papermill input.ipynb output.ipynb
```

## Inspection Methods

|                  | jq                            | Read tool           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Output           | Raw JSON with escaped strings | Clean rendered view |
| Error visibility | Buried in outputs array       | Inline after cell   |
| Cell context     | Need to piece together        | Cell IDs visible    |
| Scripting        | Better for automation         | Not scriptable      |

**Verdict:** Use Read for debugging/inspection, jq for scripting/CI.

## Quick Failure Check

```bash
# Check for tracebacks in notebook outputs
jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' notebook.ipynb | grep "Traceback"

# Count error outputs in notebook
jq '[.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error")] | length' notebook.ipynb
```

## Read Tool for Debugging

The Read tool renders ipynb with errors inline after the failing cell:

```
<cell id="MJUe">raise ValueError("intentional error")</cell>

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/notebook.py", line 5, in <module>
    raise ValueError("intentional error")
ValueError: intentional error

<cell id="vblA">y = x + 10  # depends on x, not the error cell</cell>
```

Benefits:
- Errors appear immediately after the cell that caused them
- Cell IDs visible for cross-referencing
- Full traceback with line numbers
- No JSON parsing needed

## Common Patterns

### Find the Failing Cell

Use the Read tool to inspect the notebook and locate tracebacks:
```bash
# Read notebook to find traceback location inline after failing cell
Read __marimo__/notebook.ipynb
```

### Check Cell Execution Count

Identify cells that did not execute:
```bash
# Find cells with null execution_count (not executed)
jq '.cells[] | select(.execution_count == null) | .source[:50]' notebook.ipynb
```

### Extract All Errors

Gather all error outputs from executed cells:
```bash
# Extract error tracebacks from all cells
jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error") | .traceback[]' notebook.ipynb
```

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Execute notebook with outputs captured:**
   ```bash
   # Export marimo notebook to ipynb format with all outputs
   marimo export ipynb nb.py -o __marimo__/nb.ipynb --include-outputs
   ```

2. **Run quick failure check:**
   ```bash
   # Check if execution produced tracebacks
   jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' __marimo__/nb.ipynb | grep -q "Traceback" && echo "FAILED"
   ```

3. **Inspect notebook using Read tool:**
   ```bash
   # Read the full notebook to identify failing cells and their errors
   Read __marimo__/nb.ipynb
   ```

4. **Fix source code and re-run to verify**
