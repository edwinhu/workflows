# DOCX ↔ Typst Bridge

**What this skill carries.** The names and headings are the index; for a subject none of
them carries, `grep -il <term> ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/*.md`.

!`skill-toc ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`

Typst source is the thing the repo keeps. Word is the thing coauthors edit. This skill
moves a document across that boundary **in both directions** and reconciles what comes
back.

The load-bearing fact: `typ → docx → typ` reaches a **fixed point after one pass**. So
the pipe's output is itself valid Typst, the canonical form can be committed, and
reconciling a coauthor's returned file collapses from "read two documents side by side"
to `git merge-file`.

```
   existing.docx ──canonicalize.py --from-docx──> body.typ + media/   (bootstrap, once)
                                                     │

## Scripts

All under `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`. Each is self-contained and prints `--help`.

**Run them with `uv run --script`, not `uv run python3`.** Four of the five declare
`lxml` in a PEP 723 header, and `uv run python3 <path>` ignores that header and fails
with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lxml'`. `--script` (or executing the file
directly, since the shebang is `uv run`) reads the header and provisions the dependency.

| Script | Direction | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `build.py` | typ → docx | Convert with `--reference-doc` styles **and** stamp provenance, in one step |
| `canonicalize.py` | docx → typ | **Bootstrap** an existing Word manuscript (`--from-docx`); put a body file on its fixed point; `--check` gates it; `--lint` guards the body/main split |
| `reconcile.py` | docx → typ | Resolve the ancestor, three-way merge a returned file against the repo source |
| `comments.py` | docx or Drive → JSON | Extract comments with their anchor text, resolved state, and threading |
| `provenance.py` | — | Read/write the stamp directly (build.py already applies it) |
| `expand_citations.py` | typ → typ | Freeze every computed reference — `#cite(...)` **and** `@label` — into the literal body the docx path needs |
| `make_redline.py` | docx × docx → docx | Rebuild a coauthor's **untracked** edits as real tracked changes, against a baseline (stdlib + LibreOffice; no PEP 723 header) |

## The `main.typ` / `body.typ` split

```
main.typ    #import / #let / #show / #set, then #include "body.typ"    ← typst compiles this
body.typ    pure markup: = headings, prose, #emph, #footnote           ← pandoc reads this
```

Both paths see the same prose and neither degrades the other. The split is not stylistic
tidiness — see the first fact row in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-typst/references/facts.md`.

## References — read the one the task needs

| Read | When |
|---|---|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-typst/references/conversion.md` | Any actual conversion: bootstrapping a Word manuscript into `body.typ`, building the `.docx`, reconciling a returned file, rebuilding untracked edits as a redline, extracting comments |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-typst/references/citations.md` | A manuscript whose numbers must maintain themselves — `supra note N`, `Section IV.B`, `Id.`; the `bluebook.typ` renderer, `bib_to_entries.py`, hand-authored short forms, the `entries` schema, the two-body-file split |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-typst/references/facts.md` | Before changing the conversion path, or when a build/round trip behaves in a way the commands do not explain — the pandoc and typst defects this skill normalizes around, and why each rule exists |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docx-typst/references/maintenance.md` | Changing this skill or its scripts: the test suite, the two tests that pin bugs, and what "verified" requires |

## Red Flags — STOP

| Action | Why wrong | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| About to point pandoc at `main.typ` | Its `#show` rules destroy heading semantics in the docx | Point it at `body.typ` |
| About to pass `--allow-styling` to clear a lint error | Ships a headingless Word file | Move the directives into `main.typ` |
| About to hand-edit the returned `.docx` and call it reconciled | The repo source still diverges; the next build overwrites the edits | Run `reconcile.py` and merge into the source |
| About to resolve `<<<<<<<` markers by deleting one side wholesale | Discards a coauthor's edit unreviewed | Read both sides; ask the user when the prose choice is theirs |
| About to commit a merge without reading `.merged.typ.diff` | The merge is a claim about someone else's edits, unverified | Read the diff, then commit |
| About to send a `.docx` built from an uncommitted source | Fallback 3 needs a committed blob; the ancestor is unrecoverable | Canonicalize, commit, then build |
| About to run `--from-docx` without `--media-dir` because the error is in the way | Every figure is dropped and the output still looks complete | Name the sidecar directory; it is one argument |
| About to invoke a script with `uv run python3 <path>` | The PEP 723 header is ignored and the lxml scripts die on import | `uv run --script <path>` |
| About to hand-fix `Officers"` in a recovered file | The converter did it, not the source; hand-fixes are re-corrupted next pass | Re-recover with current `canonicalize.py`, which restores `’` |
| About to name a custom citation function in the body file | pandoc dies with `Identifier not found` and no docx is produced | `#show cite:` over the built-in `#cite(<Key>)` |
| About to put live `#cite` in the file `reconcile.py` merges into | It can never be canonical; the merge churns on every citation | Keep the symbolic form in `body-src.typ`, generate the literal one |
| About to write `#cite(<a>); #cite(<b>)` in a stacked footnote | typst groups them and the `;` vanishes from the PDF | `#cite(<a>)#[;] #cite(<b>)` |
| About to hand-edit the generated `cite-data.typ` to fix a short form | It is regenerated, and `--diff` will report your fix as a delta forever | Fix the `.bib` or the CSL, then regenerate and diff |
| About to patch hayagriva to get `supra note N` | It is statically linked into typst, and note numbers are a layout property a patch cannot reach | Render citations in typst with a `#show cite:` rule |
| About to `typst compile` a freshly recovered body and conclude the conversion failed | Word's TOC arrives as links to bookmarks that are not labels | Delete the recovered TOC block; `#outline()` in `main.typ` replaces it |

## Scope

Owns **typst → docx**, and **Bluebook citation rendering in typst** — the renderer lives
here rather than in `bluebook` because it is co-designed with `expand_citations.py`, which
reads the `<bb-out>` tag it emits, and that two-file split exists only because of the docx
round trip. `bluebook` owns the RULES; this skill owns making typst emit them.

`law-review-docx` and `law-econ-docx` own **markdown → docx**; different input format, no
overlap — a markdown manuscript gets Bluebook from pandoc-citeproc and the bundled CSL, and
needs nothing here. `docx-repair` fixes OOXML damage from a cloud round trip and composes
cleanly before `reconcile.py` when a returned file is also damaged.
