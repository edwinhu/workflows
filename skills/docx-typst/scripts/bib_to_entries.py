"""Generate bluebook.typ's `entries` module from a BibTeX file.

    bib_to_entries.py --bib sources.bib --csl bluebook.csl -o cite-data.typ
    bib_to_entries.py --bib sources.bib --csl bluebook.csl --diff cite-data.typ

Without this, every cite key needs its Bluebook form typed by hand, so a .bib
of 117 entries yields a manuscript that can only reach the few already
transcribed. This closes that gap: the .bib becomes the source again.

WHY IT SHELLS OUT TO CITEPROC INSTEAD OF PARSING BibTeX

Because the output has to match what is already on the page. A hand-written
BibTeX -> Bluebook renderer would have to reproduce citeproc's output byte for
byte, quirks included -- `Lucian A Bebchuk` without the period, `.;` between
adjacent groups -- and every place it normalized instead would silently reword
a live citation nobody asked it to touch.

So it does not imitate citeproc. It RUNS citeproc, with the same CSL style the
docx path already uses. The quirks arrive by construction rather than by
reverse engineering, and the failure mode is a loud pandoc error rather than a
quietly different citation.

The one thing citeproc cannot supply is `supra note N` -- the note number is
assigned during typst's layout, long after citeproc has run. That is exactly
the division of labor bluebook.typ exists for: this script supplies the strings,
the renderer supplies the number. The short form itself IS taken from citeproc,
by citing every key a second time and reading back the author-short it chose,
rather than guessing at one.

NEVER AUTO-APPLY

`--diff` is the intended entry point for a manuscript that already has citation
data. It prints deltas and exits non-zero; it does not write. Regenerating on
top of live data is how a citation gets reworded without anyone reading it.
