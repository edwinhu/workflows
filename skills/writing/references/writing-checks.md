# Writing Common Checks

Canonical definitions for writing verification. Three vendored runners OWN the computed rows; the
review lenses OWN the four they cannot settle. Both load these definitions by the path
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/references/writing-checks.md`.

**Iron Law: Read this file before evaluating a writing claim. Inlined copies drift.**

## COMPUTED vs MODEL-EVALUATED

The **Kind** column below is the load-bearing distinction, not a convenience. A COMPUTED check is
settled by a runner's exit code, which `work` reads through `mechanicalChecks`; the row names the
exact command, and no other command settles it. A MODEL-EVALUATED check has no runner: a model reads
the draft, the outline and the plan and forms a judgement.

**The four MODEL-EVALUATED checks are reported as `MODEL-EVALUATED`, with the evidence actually
read, and NEVER as `PASS`.** `PASS` is the vocabulary of a computation. Reporting a judgement in it
tells a reader that a program checked something no program looked at, and that is how a gate stops
meaning anything without anyone noticing it stopped. Name the outline points, the pinned sources,
the sentences and the counterarguments you inspected; a `MODEL-EVALUATED` line with no quoted
evidence is a self-report, and per gate law L5 a self-report is not a gate.

Symmetrically, a COMPUTED check is never reported from reading the code and concluding it would
pass. It is reported from an exit code observed on this run.

## Check Matrix

| Check ID | Description | Kind | Produced by | Severity floor |
|----------|-------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| GRAMMAR | The plan's eight required headings, unique `CLAIM-NN`, total claim→section map, backward-pointing `Depends On` | COMPUTED | `writing_section_index.py` | CRITICAL |
| CITE | Every draft citation resolves to a bibliography key and to an outline-pinned source | COMPUTED | `writing_gate_probe.py` | CRITICAL |
| CLAIM | Every drafted section carries the claims the Claim → Section Map assigns it | COMPUTED | `writing_gate_probe.py` | CRITICAL |
| PROSE-HARD | The hard-severity structural prose constraints | COMPUTED | `writing_prose_gate.py` (wraps `prose-audit.py`) | MAJOR |
| STYLE | Ship-table diction, ALL-CAPS emphasis, register-crossing markers | COMPUTED | `writing_style_check.py` | MAJOR |
| JEV-RULES | Signposting, stacked hedges, vague attribution (`W-SIGNPOST`, `W-HEDGE`, `W-ATTRIB`) | JUDGED, scored | `rule-check.ts --rules constraints/jev/writing` (`ruleChecks`) | MAJOR at p >= 0.85 |
| COVER | Every outline point is expanded in the draft | MODEL-EVALUATED | review lens | MAJOR |
| FIDELITY | No claim goes beyond the sources its outline pinned | MODEL-EVALUATED | review lens | CRITICAL |
| TRANSITION | Each section's first and last sentences connect to its neighbours | MODEL-EVALUATED | review lens | MAJOR |
| COUNTER | Every counterargument the plan names is answered in the prose | MODEL-EVALUATED | review lens | MAJOR |

**Severity floors.** A failed check, or a judgement the evidence does not support, is **major at
minimum**. It is **critical** where it invalidates the document's thesis, its claim set, or its
sourcing: a broken plan grammar (the claim set is unreadable), an unresolved or unpinned citation
(the sourcing is unsound), a section missing its mapped claims (the thesis is not carried), or a
claim beyond its pinned sources (the sourcing does not support the thesis). `work` blocks only on
`critical|major`, so a finding filed below the floor is a finding the gate ignores.

## COMPUTED checks

Each command below is quoted verbatim and must appear byte-identically in the SKILL.md
`mechanicalChecks` list. `<proj>` is the writing project root, `<Section>` a name taken verbatim
from `## Section Outputs`, `<bib>` the Source Plan `Bibliography:` path, `<slug>` the basename of
`work`'s approved plan under `<proj>/.planning/`, and `<work plan hash>` `work`'s own `planHash`.

### GRAMMAR: the PLAN grammar is well-formed

The one thing `work` cannot supply. Four conditions, all computed from `work`'s approved plan:

1. The eight required headings each appear exactly once — `Writing Intent`, `Claims`,
   `Counterarguments`, `Document Structure`, `Claim → Section Map`, `Source Plan`,
   `Section Outputs`, `Review Surfaces`.
2. `CLAIM-NN` identifiers are unique and stable — an id means the same claim for the life of the
   document, so a renumbering is a defect, not a tidy-up.
3. The Claim → Section Map is total and single-valued: every claim gets exactly one primary section.
   A claim with none is undrafted; a claim with two has no owner, which is the same failure wearing
   a fuller table.
4. Every `Section Outputs` `Depends On` points **backward**, to a section already named above it. A
   forward or circular dependency means no drafting order exists.

```
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/scripts/writing_section_index.py <proj>
```

Exit codes: `0` = grammar clean; `1` = violations, listed as JSON on stdout; `2` = usage. **Treat
`2` as a check defect, not a content failure** — a usage exit means the check did not run, and per
gate law L4 an unrun check is never a pass. The parser also refuses to parse at all without a
well-formed `<proj>/.planning/.state/review.json`; that receipt is generated by
`scripts/writing_receipt.py` from `work`'s own two approvals and is an artifact of `work`'s authority,
never a competing one.

### The draft frontmatter contract (CITE and CLAIM both enforce it)

`writing_gate_probe.py` reads every draft through `_frontmatter` (`writing_gate_probe.py:150-159`,
defined at `writing_section_index.py:458`) **before** it looks at a single citation. A draft that
does not satisfy the contract below fails with `implementsMismatch` — and, where the section has
mapped claims but the body carries no `CLAIM-NN`, additionally with `claimIdsMissing`. Both set the
floor fail, so the probe exits `1`. This is stated here because it is otherwise invisible: nothing
in the prose of a section announces it, and every section fails on the first real run for a contract
nobody was told about.

Every draft file opens with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
implements: [CLAIM-01, CLAIM-04]
plan_hash: <`work`'s current plan hash>
---
```

- `implements:` must equal, **exactly**, the claim set the `Claim → Section Map` assigns this
  section as primary — same members, ascending by claim number (the parser sorts the expected set by
  `int(claim.split("-")[1])` and compares lists, so `[CLAIM-04, CLAIM-01]` fails). Each entry
  matches `CLAIM-NN` with **two digits**; duplicates are rejected. Exactly one `implements:` line.
- `plan_hash:` must be lowercase 64-hex and must equal **`work`'s current plan hash** — the same
  value passed as `--plan-hash`. Exactly one `plan_hash:` line. A draft written against an earlier
  plan revision fails here, which is the point: it is stale, not merely out of date.
- Missing frontmatter, an unterminated block, a wrong count of either field, or a non-`CLAIM-NN`
  entry each produce a named error inside `implementsMismatch`.

This is the plugin's approved-artifact admission surviving into the port, and it is kept
deliberately rather than inherited silently: it is what binds a drafted section to the specific
approved plan revision that authorized its claims. **When `work`'s plan hash changes, every draft's
`plan_hash:` must be updated in the same run that re-drafts against the new plan** — otherwise the
per-section gate blocks on staleness and reports nothing about citations at all.

### CITE: every citation resolves

Every citation in a draft must resolve **twice** — to a key defined in the bibliography, and to a
source that section's outline actually pinned. A citation that resolves to a bib key alone proves
only that the key exists somewhere, not that this section was sourced for it. Unfilled markers
(`[cite]`, `[citation needed]` and kin) count as unresolved, not as work in progress.

```
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/scripts/writing_gate_probe.py "<proj>/drafts/<Section>.md" --bib "<proj>/<bib>.bib" --plan "<proj>/.planning/<slug>.md" --plan-hash <work plan hash>
```

Exit codes: `0` = pass; `1` = fail, with the offending keys and line numbers under `evidence`. One
invocation per section — this is the per-section fan-out, expressed as one work task row per
section rather than as a private `.js`.

### CLAIM: every section carries its mapped claims

Every drafted section carries the claims the Claim → Section Map assigns to it, traceable by
`CLAIM-NN`, and carries **no** claim id the plan does not define. A section that silently drops a
mapped claim leaves the thesis with a hole the prose reads over; a section that invents an id has
made a claim nobody approved. The mapped set is declared in the draft's `implements:` frontmatter
field and carried in the body as `CLAIM-NN` traces — see *The draft frontmatter contract* above; a
body trace without the matching frontmatter fails just as loudly as the reverse.

Same command as CITE (one probe settles both per section):

```
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/scripts/writing_gate_probe.py "<proj>/drafts/<Section>.md" --bib "<proj>/<bib>.bib" --plan "<proj>/.planning/<slug>.md" --plan-hash <work plan hash>
```

### PROSE-HARD: the hard-severity structural constraints

The prose and AI-tell spans the engine rates `severity: "hard"` — anchored numbers, citation tense,
no bold lead, outline sync, topic sentences, short-journal form and the stop triggers. Soft-severity
spans are advisory: they print, and they never set the exit code.

```
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/scripts/writing_prose_gate.py --project <proj> --style <domain>
```

`<domain>` is the plan's `Domain:` — `legal`, `econ` or `general` — which is what makes the domain
selection real rather than decorative. The gate reads the `Draft` column of `## Section Outputs`, so
the documents it audits are exactly the ones the plan declares.

Exit codes: `0` = no hard span; `1` = blocked by a hard span; `2` = **gate defect** — a missing
engine, an unrunnable engine, unparseable output, or output with no `spans` key. Per gate law L4,
treat `2` like GRAMMAR's `2`: the check did not run, and unparsed is UNCHECKED, never clean.

**Never wire `prose-audit.py`'s own exit code to the gate.** It ends in `sys.exit(worst)`, which
conflates hard and soft: advisory puffery would block a run just as a hard violation does.
`writing_prose_gate.py` is the only sanctioned path — it invokes
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prose-audit.py` **in place** (never forked, never modified,
that tree is read-only), parses the JSON span list, and blocks only on `severity == "hard"`.

The wrapper invokes the engine through `uv run --with lxml --with pyyaml python3` itself, so the
gate's own command line does not carry those flags. Do not add or strip them: the engine reaches
`lxml` through `prose_extract.py` and PyYAML through `diction.yaml`, and raises `SystemExit` without
them — which the wrapper reports as a gate defect rather than as clean prose.

A PROSE-HARD result produced by any command other than the one quoted above is not a PROSE-HARD
result.

### STYLE: the style rules a regex settles

```
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/scripts/writing_style_check.py --project <proj> --style <domain>
```

`check.sh` runs it as a leg of the one `writing` entry. Three rules, each a pattern with no judgement
left: `SHIP-DICTION` (the Ship table's phrases — the table names the replacement), `ALL-CAPS` (a
common word capitalised for emphasis) and `REGISTER-CROSSING` (Bluebook short forms, `This Article`
or `Part II.B` outside a law review; a directional `Section 2 above` inside one). Quoted text,
code, tables and headings are skipped. Exit `0` clean, `1` findings (`file:line: RULE: text`), `2`
refusal — no prose under `drafts/`.

### JEV-RULES: the judged register rules, scored

`ruleChecks` runs `rule-check.ts --rules ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/constraints/jev/writing`. Each rule's
extractor pulls bounded candidate sentences (with `file:line` and their neighbours) from the prose
deliverable, and Jev returns P(VIOLATED) for the rule's proposition; p >= 0.85 blocks, lower verdicts
reach the lens ranked. Only calibrated rules sit in that directory: a rule is wired when live Jev
scores its violating fixture >= 0.85 and an accepted passage < 0.5. `W-FIGURES` (0.71 on its
violating fixture) and `W-BULLETS` (0.87 on an accepted numbered list) failed that bar and wait in
`constraints/jev/writing/uncalibrated/`, which the rule glob does not read; those two remain the
lens's under the tic table.

## MODEL-EVALUATED checks

No runner settles these. Report each as `MODEL-EVALUATED` with the evidence read — **never** as
`PASS`.

### COVER: every outline point is expanded

Read the section's outline and the drafted section side by side. Every outline point must be
expanded in the prose, not merely gestured at by a heading that shares its wording. Report the
outline points inspected and, for any that are unexpanded or expanded in a single unsupported
sentence, quote the outline point and the prose that was supposed to carry it.

An outline point silently dropped is the failure mode: the draft reads complete because the missing
argument left no gap behind it.

### FIDELITY: no claim beyond the pinned sources

For each claim in the drafted section, check that what the prose asserts stays inside what the
outline's pinned sources support. Three distinct failures, all of which read as fluent prose:
a claim with no pinned source at all; a claim whose pinned source supports a weaker version of it
(scope creep between the source and the sentence); and a claim whose citation is real but is doing
decorative work — the source exists and says something adjacent, not the thing claimed.

Report the claim, the source pinned for it, and what that source actually supports. **Critical**
when it reaches the thesis: an overreaching claim in a load-bearing section invalidates the
document's argument, not just one sentence.

### TRANSITION: sections connect to their neighbours

Read each section's first and last sentences against the sections on either side, in the order
`Document Structure` declares. The last sentence must hand something forward, and the first must
pick something up. A section that opens by restating its own heading and closes by summarizing
itself is a self-contained essay sitting in the middle of an argument.

Report the sentence pairs read, quoted, at each boundary — including the boundaries that hold.

### COUNTER: every planned counterargument is answered

Every counterargument the plan's `## Counterarguments` names must be actually answered in the prose
— stated fairly and then met, not named and left, and not quietly dropped between plan and draft.
Report each counterargument by its plan wording, where in the draft it is answered, and what the
answer is. A counterargument mentioned in a subordinate clause and never returned to is unanswered.

## How to use in lens and subagent prompts

Reference checks by id, and name the kind expected:

```
"Judge COVER, FIDELITY, TRANSITION and COUNTER from
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing/references/writing-checks.md against the drafted sections
and their outlines. Read the definitions in full first. Report each as MODEL-EVALUATED with the
evidence read — never as PASS. Findings are MAJOR at minimum, CRITICAL where the thesis, the claim
set or the sourcing is invalidated."
```

The four COMPUTED ids are not judged by a lens. They are `mechanicalChecks`, and `work`'s JS reads
their exit codes; a lens that reports `GRAMMAR: PASS` from reading the plan has recreated the
self-certification these checks exist to remove.
