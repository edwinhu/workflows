"""writing_flip_test.py — prove every gate check FLIPS.

A check demonstrated only passing is indistinguishable from one that always errors.
This suite asserts, for each check, that it exits 0 on a clean project and NON-ZERO on
a project broken in exactly the one way that check exists to catch.

The broken projects are GENERATED here from `fixtures/clean`, one variant per check,
each differing from clean by a single edit. They used to be 60 stored files under
`fixtures/broken/`; storing them made the flip a claim in a README that nothing
re-checked. Generating them makes it a gate that runs every time.

Each variant differs from clean in exactly ONE dimension — otherwise a single shared
defect (a missing receipt, say) drives every check non-zero for the same reason and the
flip demonstrates nothing about the check's own subject.

Exit 0 when every check flips; non-zero otherwise.
