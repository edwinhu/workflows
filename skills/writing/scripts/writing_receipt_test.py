"""Tests for writing_receipt.py — the adapter that derives the writing workflow's
on-disk approval artifacts from `work`'s two approvals.

Run directly (NOT under pytest), matching writing_gate_probe_test.py's harness:

    uv run python3 scripts/writing_receipt_test.py

Every refusal path is asserted, plus one accepted round-trip. The round-trip runs
twice: once end-to-end in a throwaway temporary project this suite owns outright,
and once NON-DESTRUCTIVELY against the persistent fixture at <skill>/fixtures/clean/,
where it derives the two approval artifacts from the plan already on disk. It never
deletes or rebuilds that fixture — every other mechanical check is demonstrated
against it, and a suite that wipes it makes those demonstrations unreproducible.

## Writing Intent
- **Thesis**: The rule should change.
- **Audience**: Legal academics.
- **Purpose**: Establish the case for reform.
- **Hook**: The existing rule fails in a recurring case.
- **Scope**: Federal doctrine; state law is excluded.
- **Domain**: legal

## Claims
- **CLAIM-01**: The current rule creates a predictable gap.
- **CLAIM-02**: A narrower replacement closes that gap.

## Counterarguments
- Administrability favors the status quo, and Part II answers with a bounded test.

## Document Structure
### Introduction
Frames the problem and previews both claims.

### Part I. The Gap
Establishes CLAIM-01.

### Part II. The Repair
Establishes CLAIM-02 and answers the counterargument.

### Conclusion
States the payoff.
