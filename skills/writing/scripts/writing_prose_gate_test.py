Five cases, each exercising the gate end to end as a subprocess against a temporary
project it builds itself (it never writes into `fixtures/`, which other checks are
demonstrated against):

  1. a hard span exits non-zero
  2. a soft-only document exits 0 with the advisory printed
  3. a missing engine exits non-zero
  4. unparseable engine output exits non-zero
  5. a planned draft that is absent exits non-zero
