NOT for searching notes or appending to the daily note - use the obsidian skill."

# Obsidian Note Organization

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Clawd's Obsidian vault follows the PARA method. Every note belongs in a specific folder — nothing lives in the vault root.

## Folder Structure

```
Vault/
├── 0. Inbox/              # Unsorted captures, quick notes
├── 1. Projects/           # Active projects with deadlines
├── 2. Areas/              # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 3. Resources/          # Reference material
│   ├── People/            # Notes about individuals
│   ├── References/        # Technical references (APIs, tools, comparisons)
│   ├── Concepts/          # Ideas, frameworks, mental models
│   └── ...                # Other resource categories as needed
├── 4. Archive/            # Completed/inactive items
└── Templates/             # Note templates
```

## Placement Rules

| Note Type | Folder | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Person (colleague, contact, public figure) | `3. Resources/People/` | `Jeffrey Peck - PSLRA Lobbyist.md` |
| API docs, tool guides, tech comparisons | `3. Resources/References/` | `Claude API - Streaming Responses.md` |
| Concepts, frameworks, mental models | `3. Resources/Concepts/` | `Efficient Market Hypothesis.md` |
| Active project with a deadline | `1. Projects/` | Current research, course prep |
| Ongoing responsibility (no end date) | `2. Areas/` | Teaching, health, finances |
| Quick capture, unsorted | `0. Inbox/` | To be filed later |
| Done, no longer active | `4. Archive/` | Past projects, old references |

## Naming Conventions

Titles should be descriptive and include context so they're findable without opening the note:

- **People**: `Full Name - Role or Context.md` (e.g., `Jeffrey Peck - PSLRA Lobbyist.md`)
- **References**: `Tool/Topic - Specific Aspect.md` (e.g., `jq - Container Compatibility Notes.md`)
- **Projects**: Use the project's natural name

Avoid generic titles like `Meeting Notes.md` or `Ideas.md` — add the date, person, or topic.

## Vault Hygiene

- The vault root directory should contain **only folders**, never loose notes
- If a note doesn't clearly fit a subcategory, place it in the parent PARA folder (e.g., `3. Resources/`) rather than the root
- When in doubt, `0. Inbox/` is the right temporary home — but follow up by filing it properly
- Periodically move completed projects from `1. Projects/` to `4. Archive/`
